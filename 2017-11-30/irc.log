[Thu 13:08:20] <manu>	Topic: DID Hardening Proposal v3
[Thu 13:08:25] <drummond>	DID Spec Hardening Proposal V3: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1je9Bnhe-1tLgP1bfCSUjvbQ_qllwCz042aGncWX7Uio/edit
[Thu 13:09:19] <manu>	drummond: This is the second of a series of calls on the DID Spec...
[Thu 13:09:31] *	dlongley will backup scribe for you manu
[Thu 13:09:38] *	manu thx
[Thu 13:10:03] <manu>	drummond: Manu and Dave weren't able to be on the call last week - our goal here is to close on the DID spec, this proposal is the next stage of discussion.
[Thu 13:10:37] <manu>	drummond: Last CG call made it seem like these are competing proposals, but that's not the case, it's just a continuation of the conversation.
[Thu 13:11:04] <manu>	drummond: We have six items we could get to consensus on with folks that were on the call last time, there are two items that are new-ish don't have consensus
[Thu 13:11:39] <manu>	drummond: Haven't had much time to move those thigns forward - interested in sync'ing w/ Manu, Dave, and anyone else that hasn't been a part of this yet to talk about first six things.
[Thu 13:12:16] <dlongley>	manu: It's a post-Rebooting version which I actually got PRs in on. Hopefully over the next couple of weeks I'll get that finalized so we can layer this work on top of that. Steady stream of PRs from now on.
[Thu 13:12:52] <manu>	drummond: Let's talk through the issues in order, questions, answers, ideally come to some sort of agreement on it.
[Thu 13:13:02] <manu>	manu: Sounds good
[Thu 13:13:06] <manu>	dlongley: Good to me.
[Thu 13:13:11] <manu>	Topic: Format Independence
[Thu 13:14:10] <manu>	drummond: This is what we talked about at TPAC - JSON-LD is great but there are people that want other serialization formats as well.

[Thu 13:14:50] *	cwebber2 not sure if we're using a queue :)
[Thu 13:15:12] <manu>	drummond: Proposal is that we have a requirement in the spec that a processor can process just the JSON w/o the JSON-LD so that the two formats are compatible. You're already doing this w/ the other specs.

[Thu 13:15:54] <ChristianLundkvist>	q?
[Thu 13:15:54] <voip-ccg>	The speaker queue is empty.
[Thu 13:17:02] <manu>	cwebber: We're doing this in ActivityPub, but we need to make sure you can go both ways - plain JSON also needs to be parsed as JSON-LD - it can be expanded into a graph and all terms are defined, new properties in the context... this is not hard to do in general... even w/ apps using naieve JSON tooling. Mastadon is using ActivityPub - they're not using JSON-LD tooling except when they're using LD Signatures, so it's nice because you can uphold both properties at  the same time.
[Thu 13:17:11] *	suedynym (~suedynym@public.cloak) has joined #ccg
[Thu 13:17:25] <manu>	cwebber: I'd like to make sure we hold up what is suggested - any JSON-LD document must be able to be treated by naieve JSON-LD tooling, but also the reverse.
[Thu 13:17:29] <manu>	dlongley: Agree completely.
[Thu 13:17:47] <manu>	drummond: That's what I got from our conversation at W3C TPAC - thoughts from others?
[Thu 13:18:05] <manu>	SamSmith: What's the overhead of carring around the context? Do you have to include the context every time?
[Thu 13:18:17] <manu>	dlongley: The overhead is a single key and value in the JSON document.
[Thu 13:18:40] <manu>	SamSmith: Ok, so you don't have to download it. So plain JSON is parsed as JSON-LD, don't you have to be able to see the context?
[Thu 13:19:00] <manu>	dlongley: Yes, if you are trying to use it as JSON-LD you have to get the context, otherwise, not.
[Thu 13:19:08] <manu>	SamSmith: Ok, but only if you're JSON-LD.
[Thu 13:19:27] <manu>	drummond: Ok, so if you are doing JSON-LD parsing, do you need to fetch the context and validate the JSON-LD document? 
[Thu 13:19:50] <manu>	dlongley: The only time you need to get the context is when you're transforming, normalizing, etc. If you're not doing that, you don't need to do that.
[Thu 13:20:38] <manu>	cwebber: What's nice is that method implementers can make it readable by plain JSON and parseable by JSON-LD, method implementers need to be careful, but you can degrade from there... use JSON native tooling... that's fine, or if you pull in as JSON-LD.
[Thu 13:20:57] <manu>	sabadello: What about JWS as signatures? Wouldn't you just use LD Signatures in all cases?
[Thu 13:21:10] <manu>	dlongley: That's an open question, don't know who wants to use JWS?
[Thu 13:21:28] <manu>	ChristianLundkvist: We're using JWS now - for attestations.
[Thu 13:22:26] <manu>	ChristianLundkvist: We did some discussion that it's unclear if the DID Document itself needs to be signed as it is fetched out of the resolver, or if it's enough that a signature is present out of band but validated in the resolver itself, and then returned in whatever data format is supported.
[Thu 13:22:45] <manu>	dlongley: I have a couple of comments - whether or not a signature is present is up to a combination of the DID Method, the resolver, and the application that's using it.
[Thu 13:22:56] *	ChristianLundkvist has quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[Thu 13:23:03] <manu>	dlongley: LD Signatures has a signature suite that is compatible with JWS... you still need to canonicalize.
[Thu 13:23:27] <manu>	SamSmith: We can't enforce canonicalization in JSON.
[Thu 13:23:52] <manu>	SamSmith: Any time you have a JSON document that embeds a signature and you reserialize - JSON doesn't have a canonical serialization, you'd have to include the part of the document signed in base 64
[Thu 13:24:18] <manu>	dlongley: The canonicalization algorithm used is on the JSON-LD data - whatever whitespace, as long as data semantics change, you can use JSON-LD to conver to RDF.

[Thu 13:24:45] <dlongley>	manu: Let me jump in really quickly. There's going to be a very severe mismatch between what Sam is saying and what we're saying because we don't have a history.
[Thu 13:25:36] <dlongley>	manu: We know about all of the shortcomings of the JOSE stack and the normalization issues. And many of those things are what led us to create the Linked Data stuff. We have 8-9+ year history working with this canonicalization, etc. Our comments aren't coming from a naive standpoint. I agree with what you're saying Sam about there being no JSON canonical form.
[Thu 13:26:01] <dlongley>	manu: When you sign with JOSE you do base64 encode it. We understand that. We know about that issue. So this concept of mixing JSON and JWS and the DID documents... I'm concerned about it.
[Thu 13:26:35] <dlongley>	manu: But that's kind of somebody else's problem. Our ledger picks JSON-LD and Linked Data Signatures for a variety of reasons because we think the end result is simpler than using plain JSON + JWS JOSE stack, etc. If someone else wants to use JSON and JWS stack etc, they have to figure that out.
[Thu 13:26:51] <dlongley>	Sam: I heard we should just stick with LDS and that's all that's supported.
[Thu 13:27:09] <dlongley>	manu: No, not saying that. This work started out with JOSE and we hit brick walls, we switched to LDS. We've been there.
[Thu 13:27:33] <dlongley>	Sam: I don't say JOSE is the answer either. Having a base64 field that is signed is something that will work in general as opposed to requiring the full JOSE stack to manage everything.
[Thu 13:27:51] <dlongley>	Sam: One of the problems with JOSE is that you can specify all the signatures with all the parameters, there are security holes.
[Thu 13:28:05] <dlongley>	Sam: It might be a strawman to say there are only LDS and JOSE as choices.

[Thu 13:28:20] <voip-ccg>	cwebber2 has been added to the queue: manu, cwebber2
[Thu 13:28:32] <dlongley>	manu: We're not saying that. We're saying we have a fairly good understanding of the shortcoming of JOSE JWS and you can do it that way if you want, that's allowable. If you want to use LDS you can do that.
[Thu 13:28:38] <manu>	ack manu
[Thu 13:28:39] <voip-ccg>	manu has the floor.
[Thu 13:29:01] <dlongley>	Sam: We went from we want to have DID docs to both using JSON tooling and JSON-LD tooling and then you need JSON-LD tooling for the signature.
[Thu 13:29:30] <dlongley>	manu: Yeah, I agree. We have to be careful though for every new thing we add here. There's a tremendous amount of complexity for each of these things, particularly for security audits.
[Thu 13:29:38] *	manu apologies cwebber2 
[Thu 13:30:09] <dlongley>	Sam: The standard protocol practice is to attach the signature after the serialization. Whereas in LDS you are embedding the signature in the Linked Data, requires canonicalization. You can't build a LD master schema where the signatures are part of your schema.

[Thu 13:30:59] <manu>	cwebber: If you end up base64 encoding and signing, you can't embed.
[Thu 13:31:10] <manu>	SamSmith: You can, but you can embed and base64 and embed.

[Thu 13:32:25] <manu>	cwebber: Even in their case, they use naieve tooling, but they do use LD signatures stuff... dev that uses it doesn't know about LD signatures - but does use the libraries. Even though you're using LD tooling, you can have a naieve tooling mindset.
[Thu 13:32:41] <manu>	SamSmith: Except that if the Linked Data tooling is doing lookups, in a data intensive app - that's expensive.
[Thu 13:33:25] <manu>	dlongley: You can cache data, that's not an issue in production, you don't do lookups in that case. I don't think anyone is saying use ONLY LD Signatures.
[Thu 13:33:45] <manu>	dlongley: We say "here are the specs on how to do X" -- we point folks at that.
[Thu 13:34:06] <manu>	SamSmith: I think that's a great thing - we may want to make it easy for people to migrate from standard JSON format to LD format.
[Thu 13:34:40] <manu>	dlongley: I think Chris' perspective is - it's just another version of JWS and a magic signature gets attached to your document, you made a call, a signature appeared, that's another way to look at LD Signatures - you don't need to bring in the mental model of signatures.
[Thu 13:35:19] <manu>	nage: Yes, you get this JSON data and you use whatever library to deal w/ the signatures... as different tech and signatures evolve, we want the central data model to keep working.

[Thu 13:37:51] <dlongley>	manu: I wanted to go back to the format independence question. If someone wants to do JSON and JWS/JWT that's fine. But someone is going to have to write and maintain those sets of specifications. Who is volunteering to do that? That's the first question. If we want that serialization to get through the W3C standardization process then at least two ledgers will need to implement that to get it through W3C rec process.
[Thu 13:38:04] <dlongley>	manu: I'd like to know who is going to be doing JSON+JWS (non-LDS version).
[Thu 13:38:25] <dlongley>	Markus: Two code bases or two ledgers?
[Thu 13:38:34] <dlongley>	manu: That's an interesting question. Not sure.

[Thu 13:39:40] <dlongley>	manu: Christian?
[Thu 13:39:50] <dlongley>	Christian: Probably? We are currently using plain JSON and JWS for most of our stuff.
[Thu 13:40:09] <dlongley>	drummond: Is there is a deeper question to ask... what methods represented on the call plan to produce signed DID documents vs. unsigned?
[Thu 13:40:18] *	kimhd sorry, late to the party. Did we bring up the unencoded, detached payload option in the RSA2017 sig suite 
[Thu 13:40:49] <dlongley>	manu: I'd phrase it differently, at some point there has to be some kind of cryptographic proof. The other concern that we have ... let me jump back. We could assert that there is no signature on a DID document, or say it's optional I mean, and that's fine across every DID method we're looking at.

[Thu 13:41:08] <dlongley>	manu: I think that's totally fine. Even in the Veres One ledger the signature is not on the DID document itself it's on an event that comes into the ledger.
[Thu 13:41:28] *	mike-lodder kimhd I don't think so
[Thu 13:41:38] <dlongley>	manu: When you fetch the DID document there's a wrapping signature there.

[Thu 13:43:38] <dlongley>	manu: The people pushing JSON-LD and LDS have a strong reason for doing so. Is the JSON and JWS stuff really buying people much? Saying things are optional and so on leads to extra security and operational costs.

[Thu 13:44:27] <manu>	drummond: It sounds like there is agreement that spec can say format is JSON-LD, but can be used as naive JSON.

[Thu 13:45:18] <manu>	drummond: Each DID Method could specify whether signatures are valid - or DID Spec can say you can attach signatures to document.
[Thu 13:45:32] <manu>	drummond: Folks at table willing to specify, here is how you do JWS signature, they can do that, and we're done.
[Thu 13:46:19] <manu>	dlongley: I'm going to try to rewind - signatures being optional - general concern that there might be some confusion over purpose of a DID Document and determining what the data model will look like, what serialization will look like - create a common format for what is returned by resolver. 
[Thu 13:46:53] <cwebber2>	+1 to applications which use DIDs regardless of DID method :)
[Thu 13:47:01] <manu>	dlongley: You improve interop by having resolvers return same DID docs - I'm thinking of this in terms of apps that want to use DIDs, regardless of what method is being used by those DIDs... when we talk about signatures - DID Document that's returned, authenticity is checked by resolver, or trust resolver in some way.

[Thu 13:48:38] <drummond>	Also, to talk about Dave's point about a common purpose of DIDs and DID docs.
[Thu 13:48:48] <manu>	dlongley: That does depend on some common method for retrieving things from these ledgers. That's going to cause resolvers to become heavyweight... build apps that have embedded resolvers, that work across multiple DID methods - it's important for us to figure out if there is a common protocol to retrieve things from a variety of ledgers... how do we create resolvers that can pull from different ledgers, we want interop between different DID Methods... there may be apps that do care about that, but for apps that don't, we want to support that.

[Thu 14:00:31] <manu>	ChristianLundkvist: I'm not sure if DID Resolver needs to spit out a DID Document w/ a signature on it - the onus on verifying that there is a cryptographically strong link between DID and DID Document falls on the resolver.

[Thu 14:00:43] <voip-ccg>	markus_sabadello has the floor.
[Thu 14:00:51] <dlongley>	if it falls on the resolver then we're going to need to have another piece (a "client" for the resolver) that actual applications use, they will not be running full nodes, etc.
[Thu 14:01:03] <drummond>	What Christian is saying is what I was trying to say, which is that the resolver can implement the verification step, and that can be method specific, and then return a "plain" DID document.
[Thu 14:01:33] <manu>	sabadello: Some comments on lightweight and heavyweight - Drummond said something about two-phase or two-part resolution architecture... logic that you need is lightweight, you could run it on a local machine... sometimes you need a full node (more heavyweight)
[Thu 14:01:45] <manu>	sabadello: BTCR DID, you can resolve it in 3 different ways... 
[Thu 14:01:58] <dlongley>	if "sometimes" you want a full node -- either people won't use them or we need another piece in the architecture to make those DID methods more tenable.

[Thu 14:03:14] *	cwebber2 is probably most guilty of meandering, sorry :)
[Thu 14:03:43] <dlongley>	manu: The conversation we're having is good but meandering a bit. I want to close out the format independence thing with a specific proposal. I think we all agree that we want format independence. There's an abstract data model, services, keys and identifiers as concepts in there.
[Thu 14:03:56] <dlongley>	manu: JSON/JSON-LD may be used there as a format for it.
[Thu 14:04:11] <dlongley>	manu: It sounds like signatures are optional. Does that close out option 1?
[Thu 14:04:43] <dlongley>	drummond: I think there's a third thing. Will we in the DID spec still specify standard signatures that we can recommend?
[Thu 14:04:48] <dlongley>	drummond: That methods can refer to.
[Thu 14:05:45] <dlongley>	manu: When it comes to W3C and how it does stuff like that, you tend to give some examples. You split into core data model where you say "here's how you express the data model as JSON/JSON-LD in examples" and you leave other serializations to external specs. You don't prevent other serializations from happening. That's perfectly reasonable, some people go more academic than that and say you should just talk about the data model full stop. Go to other specs
[Thu 14:05:45] <dlongley>	for that.
[Thu 14:06:02] <dlongley>	manu: To shortcut the conversation for this let's just put JSON and JSON-LD into the spec.
[Thu 14:06:10] <dlongley>	manu: If someone wants something else we can reopen.

DID Methods that require full method in resolver will only be used by mechanisms that ... don't want that to happen, don't want full nodes to be left out where DID is... they just want to use DIDs... run lightweight resolver for anything...

[Thu 14:09:38] <ChristianLundkvist>	Strongly disagree about putting DID resolution in blockchain nodes
[Thu 14:10:10] <manu>	dlongley: For example, if all DID Methods  -- lightweight protocol on HTTP... applications want to use any data across DID method, implement HTTP GET - don't want to reopen #1, but a piece of that might be that resolvers then place signatures on DID Document that come back and that's part of authenticatoin method, trust resolver, trust authentication that came back - sigs appear on DID Docs as they come back from resolvers... run a full node for this - people aren't going to do that for lots of apps.
[Thu 14:10:11] <sabadello>	agree with dlongley that resolvers can be run as a cloud service
[Thu 14:10:15] <drummond>	Resolvers adding signatures? From the resolver itself?
[Thu 14:10:34] <manu>	dlongley: To accept users ... we want interop - we're missing critical peice of architecture, push stuff into ledgers or resolvers are services.
[Thu 14:10:39] *	manu missed a ton of that dlongley.

[Thu 14:12:38] <manu>	drummond: For two steps - client / app talking to resolver - lightweight protocol there - Markus made the point, multiple configurations - because of the crypto involved, where the verification takes place - DID Spec, defines conformance targets.
[Thu 14:12:48] <manu>	drummond: Say "here are the different configurations"
[Thu 14:13:38] <manu>	drummond: Can work w/ Markus - you cover those so you are defining ways to resolve a DID, and refer to conformance targets... if you talk to resolver, that's how X is done, if you're adding signature, that's how Y is done - I don't think anyone is saying we should do it all at ledger/client ... all 3 are possibilities.
[Thu 14:14:19] <manu>	drummond: We can put that back out as topic - define different configs - conformance targets for implementers of spec and we need to do it in the spec. DID Docs / Methods and resolution - tackle that in context of definitions.

[Thu 14:16:41] <dlongley>	everyone is going to want to use a monolithic resolution service

[Thu 14:17:04] <manu>	drummond: We did a simpler version of this for XRDS
[Thu 14:17:28] <manu>	sabadello: I think we can define common interface for talking to resolver

[Thu 14:20:39] <dlongley>	manu: Yes, I disagree with having the ID be optional. Playing off a number of things I heard on the call today. One of the purposes of the DID document is to provide a common piece of data an application can use regardless of the DID method that's behind it. The closer the DID docs look between multiple systems, the easier it is for the ecosystem to use them.
[Thu 14:20:50] <drummond>	Ah-ha! Light bulb. If we specify a two-step resolution process, then the DID doc CAN require the DID.
[Thu 14:20:52] <dlongley>	manu: Let's make it look almost identical, that's a design goal even if we can't fully actualize it.
[Thu 14:21:15] <dlongley>	manu: Making it optional is because there's an "emergent" value that is the ID.
[Thu 14:21:40] <dlongley>	manu: I'm thinking about BTC-R there's this initial bootstrapping process and you don't know the ID until it's created after the fact. But would you ever have an application ask a resolver for something ... it has an ID it's asking for.

[Thu 14:23:12] <dlongley>	(and adding the ID could affect the validity)
[Thu 14:23:44] <dlongley>	cwebber2: It's completely reasonable that you could have an emergent document so you can't have ID when you generate it, but you can always tack on the ID when you hand it over to the user. Even if there was no way to have the ID until you do all the generation.
[Thu 14:23:56] <drummond>	I agree with Manu's point that the resolver will ALWAYS have the DID, regardless of whether it is emergent. This is why a two-step resolution process makes sense.

[Thu 14:24:55] <dlongley>	yes, we need to think about this in terms of resolution more than in terms of DID methods!
[Thu 14:24:59] <dlongley>	that's where the interop is.
[Thu 14:25:17] <manu>	drummond: This further enforces concept of two-step resolution process - you don't have to stick in another component, two step can be implemented directly by a client... two steps are separating execution of method, and whatever is returned.

[Thu 14:26:48] <manu>	drummond: Getting back to point - app can make its own security decisions on what resolver it trusts for what verification... or needs to talk to full node, or resolver - resolver code is in me - I'll trust it...
[Thu 14:27:16] <manu>	dlongley: Completely agree with that - We don't care what DID Methods do, but DID DOcuments are what pops out and that's what we're trying to standardize.

[Thu 14:32:48] <manu>	SamSmith: I'm fine w/ supporting the concept that we're talking about final document that's resolved, not some interim version.
[Thu 14:33:00] *	mike-lodder dlongley that DID-method domain is about coming to agreement on what happens when you resolve
[Thu 14:33:09] <dlongley>	the "mapping" from however things are stored by a particular DID method to how you get to the "resolved" DID document is up to the method... but it does need to say it
[Thu 14:33:23] <manu>	q+ to note that a DID Method spec can provide the interim docs and do whatever they want for internal purposes.
[Thu 14:33:23] <voip-ccg>	manu has been added to the queue: manu, manu

[Thu 14:36:39] *	mike-lodder has quit ("Leaving")
[Thu 14:37:46] <manu>	SamSmith: How do we update the hardening proposal?
[Thu 14:37:55] <manu>	drummond: Add change suggestions to docs, try not to use only comments.
[Thu 14:38:11] <manu>	dlongley: Use the suggest feature, easier to find stuff.
