<h1 id="topic-1" class="topic">Topic: W3C AB Feedback</h1>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-2').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-2').show()" id="2" class="comment"><span class="name">Matt Stone</span>:  The link in the agenda that we just dropped in to this discussion... Manu you suggested we add this to the agenda in the last day or two. Could you give us a quick intro? <a id="link-2" style="display:none;" href="#2">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-3').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-3').show()" id="3" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: W3C AB Feedback: <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2016Nov/0011.html">https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2016Nov/0011.html</a> <a id="link-3" style="display:none;" href="#3">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-4').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-4').show()" id="4" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Sure. The discussion (the AB feedback) ... just a precursor to this, this is W3C member-confidential, so we can&apos;t actually talk about the contents or what people said. We can only talk about what is in the public. <a id="link-4" style="display:none;" href="#4">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-5').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-5').show()" id="5" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  The W3C advisory board, they are elected, there are 10 on the board, 3 of them are Tantek (Mozilla), Chris Wilson (Google), Mike Champion (Microsoft). These three have raised concerns about the VC work publicly. <a id="link-5" style="display:none;" href="#5">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-6').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-6').show()" id="6" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Email from Mike Champion of Microsoft: <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments-comments/2016Nov/0022.html">https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments-comments/2016Nov/0022.html</a> <a id="link-6" style="display:none;" href="#6">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-7').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-7').show()" id="7" class="comment"><span class="name">Shane McCarron</span>: Huzzah! <a id="link-7" style="display:none;" href="#7">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-8').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-8').show()" id="8" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Mike Champion from MS sent an email in that basically said that ... it was good. He was convinced that the education industry use cases meet the requirements for effectively starting a working group. He said he&apos;s &quot;personally&quot; persuaded, doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s a MS position. That&apos;s good that we have met the REC track readiness criteria. <a id="link-8" style="display:none;" href="#8">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-9').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-9').show()" id="9" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: REC track readiness criteria: <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/standards-track/">https://www.w3.org/Guide/standards-track/</a> <a id="link-9" style="display:none;" href="#9">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-10').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-10').show()" id="10" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  He says we&apos;ve met that for VC. <a id="link-10" style="display:none;" href="#10">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-11').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-11').show()" id="11" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  MS could still formally object if someone else doesn&apos;t want the work to proceed. Mike is convinced from an education perspective, specifically, Matt Stone, Richard Varn, and Nate Otto said things that were convincing. Then he wants to hear from the retail space. We&apos;ve raised this and we need to hear from Bob Burke, Jay, and we&apos;ve heard from Gray Taylor from Conexxus but Mike didn&apos;t find that compelling. He wants to see the implementers, not in general, but the specific spec being put forward. And do they have the ability to put this into the market. That&apos;s where he&apos;s coming from. <a id="link-11" style="display:none;" href="#11">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-12').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-12').show()" id="12" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Those are the types of responses that Mike needs to hear to convince him. <a id="link-12" style="display:none;" href="#12">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-13').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-13').show()" id="13" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I think that&apos;s where we are right now. Matt over to you. <a id="link-13" style="display:none;" href="#13">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-14').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-14').show()" id="14" class="comment"><span class="name">Matt Stone</span>:  A followup question to that is ... I know we spawned out of the Web Payments IG as a need to solve issues in the payments space. And it turns out that another vertical may be more mature in the need (Education). So what? Maybe we validated that we need a standard for industries that are not payments. What happens if we leave them behind and we don&apos;t satisfy his need for a use case in that space? <a id="link-14" style="display:none;" href="#14">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-15').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-15').show()" id="15" class="comment"><span class="name">Shane McCarron</span>: (I am not concerned; there are payments people who care; lots of them) <a id="link-15" style="display:none;" href="#15">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-16').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-16').show()" id="16" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  This places the Web Payments IG in an awkward position, they voted unanimously to put the charter up for a vote at W3C in the first place. I would expect that we&apos;d hear from the IG. If we don&apos;t, then payments get removed from the charter and that&apos;s that. It&apos;s mostly that that group didn&apos;t expect to be taken out of the charter. <a id="link-16" style="display:none;" href="#16">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-17').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-17').show()" id="17" class="comment"><span class="name">Matt Stone</span>:  Is that something that you and your relationship with the Web Payments members would drive? <a id="link-17" style="display:none;" href="#17">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-18').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-18').show()" id="18" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Yes. <a id="link-18" style="display:none;" href="#18">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-19').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-19').show()" id="19" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  And Shane, I don&apos;t know if you want to say anything. <a id="link-19" style="display:none;" href="#19">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-20').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-20').show()" id="20" class="comment"><span class="name">Shane McCarron</span>:  I put it in IRC already, there are payments people who care and they&apos;ll speak up. <a id="link-20" style="display:none;" href="#20">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-21').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-21').show()" id="21" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We&apos;ve requested space on the IG call next week to discuss this. <a id="link-21" style="display:none;" href="#21">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-22').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-22').show()" id="22" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  The discussion seems to be around &quot;Yes, but who has actually implemented this out in the field as REC track readiness criteria.&quot; What Chris, Tantek, Mike seem to be saying is that they need to see people who have implemented the spec as it stands right now in the wild and this is kind of a new thing at W3C and it&apos;s not an opinion that is shared by all W3C members. The general tenor from them seems to be that standards should be discovered and not created, and even though we have organizations saying they&apos;ve been implementing this stuff for a decade plus, and their response is &quot;You haven&apos;t implemented this *specific thing* and how does it solve a problem you couldn&apos;t solve before?&quot; <a id="link-22" style="display:none;" href="#22">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-23').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-23').show()" id="23" class="comment"><span class="name">Phil Hunt</span>:  I think you have all put in so much effort, I don&apos;t know why it&apos;s even a thing and the sooner we get this on the road the better, I&apos;d like to stop arguing and get on with it. This thing with incubation I think you&apos;ve proved it. I understand why creating standard before market is a bad idea, but this group is being asked to do things that have never been asked to do. I&apos;m amazed that anyone of you are even bothering to show up at this point. <a id="link-23" style="display:none;" href="#23">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-24').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-24').show()" id="24" class="comment"><span class="name">Shane McCarron</span>: I *love* being the first one to break ground at the W3C. :/ <a id="link-24" style="display:none;" href="#24">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-25').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-25').show()" id="25" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Thank you Phil, great to hear from W3C staff that you feel that the bar here is fantastically high. I think the reason the AB discussed this is because reps want to see something changed at W3C. They are concerned that W3C staff is spread too thin and they want to see thorough incubation before work started and the VC work was just coming to a head just as they feel that the way they fee labout changing W3C is also coming to a head. They have new criteria that they want to see become part of the W3C process. They are exercising that philosophy on use through their positions on the AB and as large W3C members. <a id="link-25" style="display:none;" href="#25">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-26').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-26').show()" id="26" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I don&apos;t think we&apos;re the first to break new ground, this is a new thing that they want to see happen and they are using us to push that discussion, is my view. <a id="link-26" style="display:none;" href="#26">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-27').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-27').show()" id="27" class="comment"><span class="name">Shane McCarron</span>: I also love being used. :P <a id="link-27" style="display:none;" href="#27">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-28').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-28').show()" id="28" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  But, with that happening, I think we have actually done the things they want us to do. For example, Chris Wilson has said there are no implementations, but there are and they are deployed (Digital Bazaar, ACDT, Pearson, ETS). There&apos;s clearly a miscommunication that&apos;s happened. <a id="link-28" style="display:none;" href="#28">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-29').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-29').show()" id="29" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  They want to see a system they can use that uses this spec. <a id="link-29" style="display:none;" href="#29">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-30').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-30').show()" id="30" class="comment"><span class="name">Phil Hunt</span>:  I was looking at the use case document. The use case document is deliberately generic. I was asking whether ... Mike Champion, who seems to be softening which is nice, he was saying is there an ecosystem. And we say &quot;Yes&quot;. And you say we took the specifics out to make a nice use case document. I think everyone in this group has put enough effort into this. I want to look at the charter and do some bits and bobs with it. I want to go to W3M and talk with them and they need to review it internally and I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any problem and I think it will go to the AC in the coming weeks. Unless I find anything else, I would be inclined to move the conversation and get on with what you want to do instead of answering the same question from the same people all the time. <a id="link-30" style="display:none;" href="#30">✪</a></div>
<h1 id="topic-2" class="topic">Topic: Specific Use Cases</h1>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-31').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-31').show()" id="31" class="comment"><span class="name">Matt Stone</span>:  So, last week, specifically the use cases have a pendulum swing/yo-yo pattern. On one hand too specific and then too generic. We show one, they want to see the other one. So it seems. <a id="link-31" style="display:none;" href="#31">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-32').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-32').show()" id="32" class="comment"><span class="name">Matt Stone</span>: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sTlymbzQ2zQsgnWDaNBXTq3aZ77RD_Jp5u9p9DLAcfA/edit#">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sTlymbzQ2zQsgnWDaNBXTq3aZ77RD_Jp5u9p9DLAcfA/edit#</a> <a id="link-32" style="display:none;" href="#32">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-33').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-33').show()" id="33" class="comment"><span class="name">Matt Stone</span>:  We started a very brief, pragmatic document, from healthcare, education, commerce, KYC. Here are the current use cases that are in practice today that are representative of the marketplace out in the wild where a standard would facilitate interop, privacy, and other goals we have. Can we shift gears about what we need to do, is that the last nail in the coffin so we can move onto issues in the spec. <a id="link-33" style="display:none;" href="#33">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-34').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-34').show()" id="34" class="comment"><span class="name">Matt Stone</span>:  Here&apos;s the document that I just put into IRC&gt; <a id="link-34" style="display:none;" href="#34">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-35').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-35').show()" id="35" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I think one of the things that ... when Phil sent us the email, can we get some documented use cases with real world data, and I think a number of us are just trying to get that data here. I know our organization has a bunch of VC that we&apos;re talking with various companies about and we&apos;re engaged in pilots. I know Pearson, Evernym, Open Badges, etc have this stuff and we can talk about it and show the friction points on what&apos;s out there. <a id="link-35" style="display:none;" href="#35">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-36').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-36').show()" id="36" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Once we document this stuff we&apos;ll link to it from the use cases ... is that what you&apos;d find useful, Phil? <a id="link-36" style="display:none;" href="#36">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-37').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-37').show()" id="37" class="comment"><span class="name">Phil Archer</span>:  You already got a well written use cases document. Given the work you&apos;ve done here, I&apos;d be inclined ... as a suggestion here, under each generic use cases, you could say &quot;Real world situations where this applies&quot; with one, ideally more cases. These are real world companies that are happy to be named and if we meet these use cases then we&apos;ve solved these problems. I would update the use case document with these real cases rather than trying to do anything new. <a id="link-37" style="display:none;" href="#37">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-38').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-38').show()" id="38" class="comment"><span class="name">Matt Stone</span>:  It seems like where we are then is, we have a group of us trying to collect real world examples, running right now in a parallel doc and the goal would be to bring them back into the official use case doc and either embed or refer to them. <a id="link-38" style="display:none;" href="#38">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-39').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-39').show()" id="39" class="comment"><span class="name">Shane McCarron</span>: Happy to update the use cases with other data! <a id="link-39" style="display:none;" href="#39">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-40').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-40').show()" id="40" class="comment"><span class="name">Matt Stone</span>:  I hear that right? <a id="link-40" style="display:none;" href="#40">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-41').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-41').show()" id="41" class="comment"><span class="name">Phil Archer</span>:  It&apos;s not part of the charter. This is the use case doc that you&apos;re working on for the working group. I&apos;m pretty sure the charter is as it&apos;s going to be. This is simply to the acknowledge the discussion that&apos;s been going on and it can go out in the call to the AC for review. <a id="link-41" style="display:none;" href="#41">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-42').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-42').show()" id="42" class="comment"><span class="name">Matt Stone</span>:  Sure. <a id="link-42" style="display:none;" href="#42">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-43').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-43').show()" id="43" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I would propose a slightly different strategy; we would still gather the data and put it in the doc, but maybe have a different section with real world data. 30-40-50 people have reviewed the use cases document at this point but don&apos;t have the real world data in the document and maybe what we need in the document is a section that just talks about real world data. And we say &quot;For example, here are some VC in the wild today. And we put an example of open badges, pearson/acclaim stuff, ETS examples, JohnTibbets IMSGlobal, we&apos;ve got examples from DHS, we just put that in there with a bunch of claims and say this is what it looks like and say what&apos;s deployed, etc. <a id="link-43" style="display:none;" href="#43">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-44').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-44').show()" id="44" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Any thoughts on that approach? <a id="link-44" style="display:none;" href="#44">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-45').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-45').show()" id="45" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: +1 <a id="link-45" style="display:none;" href="#45">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-49').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-49').show()" id="49" class="comment"><span class="name">Shane McCarron</span>: (Just so people can find the information) <a id="link-49" style="display:none;" href="#49">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-50').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-50').show()" id="50" class="comment"><span class="name">Matt Stone</span>:  I think that&apos;s a reasonable way to represent this. When I go through the use cases I don&apos;t want to page through a bunch of examples that don&apos;t apply to my industry. Right now I can read use cases and see how theey apply. This goes in the appendix. <a id="link-50" style="display:none;" href="#50">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-51').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-51').show()" id="51" class="comment"><span class="name">Bob Burke</span>:  With coupon media we see some applications and should we talk about what we want to do moving forward as well? We see applications for it, we just haven&apos;t done it yet. <a id="link-51" style="display:none;" href="#51">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-52').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-52').show()" id="52" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Yes, basically Mike Champion from MS needs to hear that from you and even just a mock up of what you want to do, he needs to hear it. Right now he&apos;s not hearing it and thinks you aren&apos;t there, when we know that you&apos;re here. <a id="link-52" style="display:none;" href="#52">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-53').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-53').show()" id="53" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I don&apos;t think we&apos;d embed the examples directly in the document because they are very large, but we can link to them. We can store them in the directory. You wouldn&apos;t have to thumb through pages of content. <a id="link-53" style="display:none;" href="#53">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-54').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-54').show()" id="54" class="comment"><span class="name">Matt Stone</span>:  Ok. <a id="link-54" style="display:none;" href="#54">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-55').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-55').show()" id="55" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Phil, would that meet the requirements that you have, for links to real world data? <a id="link-55" style="display:none;" href="#55">✪</a></div>

Satisfying the demands from the AC and the AB. And getting the use cases document ready for publication as a WG in the new year. The CSV on the Web use case document is really good, it has real world data, nothing made up. I would be inclined to say, yes, put them in the appendix, wherever. At this stage now, I think we&apos;re just trying to get agreement to go ahead with this.

When it goes out for review, it will include some of that information. It&apos;s for me to document what you&apos;ve already documented and put that forward to the AC. I&apos;ve read the discussions, I can see why they&apos;ve been saying this. I know they&apos;ve been asking the same question and getting answers. I&apos;ve very confident that there will be a VCWG in the new year.

Gray Taylor is the executive director of Conexxus, all fuel and retail in the US. If you buy fuel in the US or buy from a convenience store, you deal with the tech standards they put out there. Their primary use case is around age verification. It&apos;s for exactly what you said, it&apos;s for making sure a person is above a certain age to buy things like tobacco, alcohol, etc. from a convenience store. This is a primary use case for this and they are looking for VC that can address that and we have it in our use cases.

A number of us got together and hashed out all of hte initial privacy considerations when it comes to VC. I know that Wendy at W3C is really concerned about privacy here and there are a number of EU mandates that are really important to take into consideration when talking about privacy, orgs that don&apos;t provide a certain level of privacy can be fined, very seriously. To attempt to address that we have a fairly good, high-level privacy consideration section. We have 15 items there, many not filled out that were discussions as section headers in the spec right now and we expect all of those things to filled out over the lifetime of the WG. You asked a general question: &quot;Are you thinking about privacy?&quot; And the short answer is &quot;Absolutely&quot;. <a id="link-78" style="display:none;" href="#78">✪</a></div>

The things between now and the formation of the WG, one of us will get to it, we need to get this spec into its own github repo, and then start adding issues, document the issues associated with that github repo. Typically every spec gets its own repo, use cases, its own repo, data model spec its own repo, etc. then start logging issues. The chairs and editors should look at the issues and prioritize them in a way that meets the goals of the WG. Rinse and repeat. There will be specs in github repos, issues logged against them. Most of the discussions happen on the github tracker these days instead of the mailing list. There&apos;s a process that W3C, we&apos;re seeing used more and more at WGs. <a id="link-89" style="display:none;" href="#89">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-92').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-92').show()" id="92" class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  Having multiple use cases just seem to challenge that. In the CSVW case, there was a CSVW org where we could collect everything, sometimes issues span multiple specs and we could organize there. Being able to tag issues across all the different specs they might touch. If we go into multiple repos I&apos;m concerned we&apos;ll lose cross linking and resource sharing. <a id="link-92" style="display:none;" href="#92">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-93').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-93').show()" id="93" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Just to note how we address this in the Web Payments IG...has an IG repo, where general issues are raised that affect all the specs. Just a holding spot for issues that bridge a number of different specs. We also have spec-specific issue trackers that are just for issues for a very specific spec. Having those different issue trackers seems to be ok, people are ok with that. The other thing you raised is a technical question, how do you refer to a shared glossary. We publish everything to github pages and then you cross link to all the specs and pull in terminology from a common repo, etc. We did that with WPIG. Each spec pulls that terminology in thanks to a number of extensions that Shane did. There&apos;s a pattern we can follow that works in the WPIG. <a id="link-93" style="display:none;" href="#93">✪</a></div>
