<div onmouseout="$('#link-3').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-3').show()" id="3" class="comment"><span class="name">Kim Hamilton Duffy</span>:  Changing the agenda a bit, we have a google doc tracking the work items and Christopher started breaking that down into items the digital verification group would work on and I thought it would out more naturally if we discuss the work items first and that would inform the digital verification question more. Then leave a bit more time for reviewing the mission statement. Sound ok? <a id="link-3" style="display:none;" href="#3">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-14').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-14').show()" id="14" class="comment"><span class="name">Kim Hamilton Duffy</span>:  Starting with a proposal for how we go through this, talk through ambiguities, scope, etc. then next steps. This isn&apos;t a concrete proposal yet but one way to do it is to say if a topic has no champions we scratch it or someone gets the urgency to then champion it. Proposals for how to move forward and then maybe closing it down. <a id="link-14" style="display:none;" href="#14">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-15').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-15').show()" id="15" class="comment"><span class="name">Kim Hamilton Duffy</span>:  Any questions on scope or anything you&apos;ve seen on the work items? <a id="link-15" style="display:none;" href="#15">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-16').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-16').show()" id="16" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  One of the key things that I was really hoping for was clarifying more on champion vs. supporters. People haven&apos;t articulated the difference so I want to make sure we&apos;re there. It&apos;s been my experience that in WG people will do it whether others will or not, that&apos;s a champion. They want input and to do the group process but they have energy, time, and commitment to so it. Supporters instead want to see it done but it isn&apos;t their top priority as other things might get in the way and slow it down. We have a lot of items and we may push things up but having a champion is an important part of the criteria. <a id="link-16" style="display:none;" href="#16">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-17').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-17').show()" id="17" class="comment"><span class="name">Kim Hamilton Duffy</span>:  One thing that we should take from that is that if you are listed as a champion but you don&apos;t have intent to work on it, don&apos;t have time, etc. switch to supporter. <a id="link-17" style="display:none;" href="#17">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-18').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-18').show()" id="18" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Right so, I wanted to clarify some thoughts on the work items in the document. Having reviewed them. Question was raised in the VCWG call today ... would these be better done by that WG instead of this one with potential input from this group. Terminology is one of those things. That&apos;s a critical item for the WG. I&apos;m trying to say that the WG will do that with input from this group. I&apos;m making a note on terminology that this is a WG potential item. <a id="link-18" style="display:none;" href="#18">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-19').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-19').show()" id="19" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>: Terminology includes DIDs and such <a id="link-19" style="display:none;" href="#19">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-20').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-20').show()" id="20" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Lifecycle of a VC, I think I understand that, the more than just claims one and direct vs. indirect claims, I&apos;m not quite sure what that work is about. I understand ... it feels like it&apos;s a fairly large vision. As far as work items are concerned they tend to get done when narrowly scoped. These seem important but scope is large and so they may hang out forever. Wondering if we can narrow those. <a id="link-20" style="display:none;" href="#20">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-21').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-21').show()" id="21" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  The other thing I noticed is that it feels like there are core specifications and supporting documentation. There might be a tension in the group with wanting to dive into the core specs because a number of us have commercial interests, vs. supporting documentation which we need to convince W3C to pick up the work with a WG. Both are important, but I foresee some tension on those because some want to dive into core specs without supporting docs and others wanting to do supporting docs. Wondering if chairs or others have put into how we deal with the tension. <a id="link-21" style="display:none;" href="#21">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-22').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-22').show()" id="22" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We can&apos;t really prevent anything from happening if people want to work on different things. <a id="link-22" style="display:none;" href="#22">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-23').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-23').show()" id="23" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  The other question has more to do with the DVCG. If we want to rebrand the CCG, it feels like a lot of what we&apos;re doing is actually about digital verification. And the Digital Verification group is more about signature formats, it&apos;s about signing data. I&apos;m wondering if the group has thought about that. Maybe this group becomes the Digital Verification Community Group and then we rebrand the current one as a signatures group. <a id="link-23" style="display:none;" href="#23">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-24').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-24').show()" id="24" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Just a bunch of thoughts. <a id="link-24" style="display:none;" href="#24">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-25').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-25').show()" id="25" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  I spent a bit of time organizing this, etc. I do feel like there is a tension between the fundamentals as supporting docs. It falls into a difference of credential work items and digital verification CG to me. Terminology, one of the things I was thinking of here is that there&apos;s a lot of things we want to be consistent with the WG. There are things like DIDs, trust anchors, etc. Part of the reason I like DV is that it includes timestamps which aren&apos;t signatures, etc. I feel like there&apos;s a role, it should be closely aligned maybe 80% in VC and 20% that isn&apos;t. The lifecycle of a VC is somewhat of a response to not being able to talk about protocols easily in the VCWG because of charter and as that WG can start accepting we can move over there. <a id="link-25" style="display:none;" href="#25">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-26').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-26').show()" id="26" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  I wanted Noah and Harlan at this meeting because they directly faced a problem ... R3 introduced self-sovereign identity and they separated evidences and assertions from the claims. We need to be careful that we&apos;re... if I&apos;ve heard once before that you can express these other things as claims as well and if that&apos;s true I want to make sure that it works for some of these other people who have taken an independent look at it and split things off. It&apos;s an important issue and it feels appropriate ... also applies to direct vs. indirect claims. I can see the browser API and polyfill is more of a spec and it&apos;s deeper down. Maybe that can be fit into the verification work items and the Web of Trust schema and could directly go to the VCWG. That&apos;s my quick overview. <a id="link-26" style="display:none;" href="#26">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-27').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-27').show()" id="27" class="comment"><span class="name">Joe Andrieu</span>:  I think the more than claims/direct vs. indirect claims may be part of the terminology section. Some of that is semantics, what do you mean by these things and how they fit in. I like Manu&apos;s assertion that the terminology is part of WG. What happens when we run into terminology that&apos;s out of scope for that WG? How do we talk about the terms that can&apos;t be addressed by that group. I wanted to talk about this tension, which I agree, supporting vs core. It&apos;s an inevitable thing. Since I&apos;m a requirements engineer I like this upfront work. It&apos;s not so much about documenting but figuring out what you really need. I think we&apos;re really missing what would drive terms of use, scope or expiration of a claim. Or how to present selected claims for different but multiple credentials. Part of that is a rush is given the mental model of a productive I&apos;m developing that&apos;s what I think. <a id="link-27" style="display:none;" href="#27">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-28').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-28').show()" id="28" class="comment"><span class="name">Kim Hamilton Duffy</span>:  Developing some more nodes in our decision tree... there may be some topics more properly owned by the WG but there are some where that might make sense we also want to be actively contributing, where we encounter use cases that differ. I am curious to ask, do we have anyone on the call right now who sees themselves more as part of the DVCG ... and do they think should they be separate groups or join, etc.? <a id="link-28" style="display:none;" href="#28">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-29').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-29').show()" id="29" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  It does feel like there are as many as four different categories now. We have a number of items that are clearly fit into the VCWG, things like defining requirements, foundational docs. Things more spec oriented, two categories, one of which is the DV, DIDs also. We kind of need it, no one else is doing it, it&apos;s here for now, but it&apos;s a separate group of people potentially. And we have items, I know Kim expressed deep interest in getting down ... reference implementations of things to see if it works. <a id="link-29" style="display:none;" href="#29">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-30').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-30').show()" id="30" class="comment"><span class="name">Kim Hamilton Duffy</span>:  So we&apos;re sliding into DVCG integration and maybe that&apos;s better to just let that happen. One thing I was wondering ... does anyone have any thoughts on where to go from here on making these decisions. I know there are certain areas I&apos;ve very interested in and the ones I can champion and would gladly sign up for and will do no matter what I know what that is, maybe we can have people who are interested in Championing and put forward what those are and maybe use the voting system that Manu or Christopher described ... where should we go/approach this? <a id="link-30" style="display:none;" href="#30">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-31').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-31').show()" id="31" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  I wanted to come back to ... now that we&apos;ve opened this up to the bigger thing of DV, I&apos;ve been reaching out to a variety of parties that haven&apos;t been as active or active at all in the credentials community, cryptographers, security professionals, blockchain space, like block stack should be technically using this family of stuff but not participating in the WG or VC task force, etc. Something in my gut says that because we aren&apos;t doing spec level things or have specs for people to review is maybe why they aren&apos;t participating as much. There is maybe a need for separating the DV out as more spec oriented. I&apos;ve got one cryptographer in mind ... I really like his work at hyperledger and will see if I can&apos;t get him in here because he is a person that can look at these specs and say &quot;wait you haven&apos;t addressed this etc&quot; maybe even willing to be a co-chair that could attract more like him. So I&apos;m inclined to keep the groups separate. We can change the name for things that are at the spec stage in that group somehow... <a id="link-31" style="display:none;" href="#31">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-37').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-37').show()" id="37" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I&apos;m wondering, during last week&apos;s call that we want to be careful with merging groups because we just separated them out. I may be reverse that hearing this discussion. We don&apos;t want to lose momentum in groups. Splitting out for the survival of the group because of too much momentum makes sense but it sounds like the vast majority of items that we want to do have to do with DV and that&apos;s incredibly broad which is good for a CG. We could shove all of these items into a DV CG and no one would question whether the spec or supporting material belonged. If you did the same with the CCG, people could argue against it. I think this is an argument to rebrand all the work under the DVCG and go forth... and only split work off when it feels like we have critical mass. <a id="link-37" style="display:none;" href="#37">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-38').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-38').show()" id="38" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  The only issue is if people object to doing that. <a id="link-38" style="display:none;" href="#38">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-39').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-39').show()" id="39" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Renaming and concerns we&apos;ll have to talk with W3C systems team and they might just say we can&apos;t rename the group and we&apos;ll have move everyone over and we&apos;ll lose 60 members who aren&apos;t paying attention to the mailing list on a weekly basis. Rebranding everything under DVCG would be the proposal, move all the specs there. <a id="link-39" style="display:none;" href="#39">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-40').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-40').show()" id="40" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  People work on the things they really want to work on, telling us priorities. <a id="link-40" style="display:none;" href="#40">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-41').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-41').show()" id="41" class="comment"><span class="name">Kim Hamilton Duffy</span>:  I think that makes a lot of sense. I think the renaming alone describes more clearly what we&apos;re working on. Depending on who&apos;s interested in a topic, what you will get out of it. I think one thing we could do is combine champions and supporters in a way, so that if I&apos;m working on a prototype that would lead into a specification but I don&apos;t have as much experience there others could help out. So I think because of that I&apos;m liking the idea that we&apos;re under an umbrella group. If we have a concrete deliverable we&apos;re working on and have people with different strengths that could work really well. <a id="link-41" style="display:none;" href="#41">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-44').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-44').show()" id="44" class="comment"><span class="name">Matt Stone</span>:  I think having two groups sort of forces us to have discussions like &quot;we can&apos;t have that discussion here&quot;. That&apos;s challenging if you don&apos;t have the right parties in the call. Based on our discussions over the last few years, the term &quot;credential&quot; has turned into a land mine that would be nice if we could just move away from. DV is a pretty good fit for what we&apos;re trying to do. That may be a better feeder from big ideas to implementable standards without having a land mind of credentials thrown into it all the time. <a id="link-44" style="display:none;" href="#44">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-47').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-47').show()" id="47" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  I&apos;ll concede to merging the two. I don&apos;t want to get lost in the specs too deeply without also considering some of these higher level things. I have some real concerns and we keep talking about data minimization and selective disclosure but we don&apos;t say what they are and best practices, crypto techniques, reasonable, possible, etc. We could put a lot of work into a spec that doesn&apos;t focus on a privacy and data minimization property and have to throw the spec away. If I look at the list on the bottom, the redaction signature suite which has some challenges but it&apos;s one of the closest that allows for data minimization and it could be a requirement for some of these types of things. The intent of every node ... that is separate and you can just include a hash of the node or something of that nature when sending it on to another party. The current one doesn&apos;t quite work because it doesn&apos;t have nonces from a security perspective. But you&apos;ve got the way to have a large signed claim and just give a small piece of it and it&apos;s still valid. Data minimization way of addressing privacy.

<div onmouseout="$('#link-49').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-49').show()" id="49" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We don&apos;t want people working on specs where the specs don&apos;t necessarily meet requirements the group has, but at the same time the group doesn&apos;t have control over what people work on or what they believe the correct requirements are etc. But spec writers will get hints from the community as to whether they are going in the right direction. In Christopher&apos;s point, if the spec doesn&apos;t have the right privacy features, implementers will say it&apos;s not meeting needs. Community Groups tend to work in a pro &quot;fork the spec&quot; or &quot;submit PRs&quot; or writing emails to the group to convince people to move another way. I don&apos;t think we should spend too much time wringing hands over people picking up and writing a spec. That&apos;s the core thing that gets things done, or people doing implementations and then writing specs after the fact. IF we&apos;re doing that we&apos;re successful, everything else is fine tuning. <a id="link-49" style="display:none;" href="#49">✪</a></div>

Dumping all these specs into a group isn&apos;t a bad thing, the things people want to work on will get worked on and everything else will fall by the way side. <a id="link-50" style="display:none;" href="#50">✪</a></div>

That gives us a lose idea of what people want to work on and the importance.
