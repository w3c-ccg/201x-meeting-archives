[2019-05-07T16:45:38.535Z]	<Lionel_Wolberger>	... We could invite an NVC expert (no charge)

[2019-05-07T16:46:29.838Z]	<Lionel_Wolberger>	... unfortunately some communication brought this to the fore, hopefully this is enough of a response and we can get on with the work

[2019-05-07T16:46:47.987Z]	<Lionel_Wolberger>	Heather: +1 to the chairs, impressive that the chairs took the survey seriously, thanks

[2019-05-07T16:47:08.969Z]	<manu>	q+ to support the general approach, really happy about this discussion.
[2019-05-07T16:47:11.133Z]	<Lionel_Wolberger>	... Had a relevant session at IIW that I will write up
[2019-05-07T16:47:18.339Z]	<kimhd>	+1
[2019-05-07T16:47:35.016Z]	<Justin_R>	+1 to heather
[2019-05-07T16:47:35.080Z]	<Lionel_Wolberger>	... To preserve momentum on this work, there's not just a check-off, needs touchpoints
[2019-05-07T16:47:54.839Z]	<Lionel_Wolberger>	... have the chairs considered a check-in schedule, not every week, but some course correction check-ins
[2019-05-07T16:48:53.688Z]	<Lionel_Wolberger>	Kim: Chairs intend on-going work, open to some ideas on a check-in. Perhaps at start do it more often.
[2019-05-07T16:49:01.992Z]	<Lionel_Wolberger>	... add a category to the ongoing agenda items.
[2019-05-07T16:49:19.459Z]	<Lionel_Wolberger>	... "Does anyone have anything that they wanted to offer?"
[2019-05-07T16:49:50.218Z]	<heathervescent>	+1 Kim, for highlighting in the agenda. I think if this is a brief, but weekly reminder will help us integrate this process... but I do not want this to take away from the work we are accomplishing here.
[2019-05-07T16:50:35.979Z]	<Lionel_Wolberger>	* +1 Moses, the NVC is really interesting

[2019-05-07T16:51:32.589Z]	<Lionel_Wolberger>	Manu: +1 to everyting Kim said. Happy this discussion is happening. Approach that the chairs put together is exactly the right way to tackle some of these really difficult issues.
[2019-05-07T16:51:52.321Z]	<Lionel_Wolberger>	... I think this group is in the forefront at least within W3C, most other W3C focuses only on the technical
[2019-05-07T16:52:03.838Z]	<Lionel_Wolberger>	... Given our topic we need to focus on these things
[2019-05-07T16:52:13.594Z]	<Lionel_Wolberger>	... Also the mentorship sounds really good

[2019-05-07T16:53:09.347Z]	<MosesM>	Manu and Lionel, I will work with the chairs to figure out what to do NVC wise
[2019-05-07T16:53:17.357Z]	<Lionel_Wolberger>	Joe: Decentralized topic @ IIW
[2019-05-07T16:53:42.351Z]	<Lionel_Wolberger>	... 1st one was open ended, IIW is ideal for this type of open discussion, gen'l idea of what would it mean if a DID was decentralized enough
[2019-05-07T16:53:51.269Z]	<Lionel_Wolberger>	... session2, break it into rubrics
[2019-05-07T16:54:05.510Z]	<Lionel_Wolberger>	... given a good rubric, we could apply it to a DID method and assess if it is decentralized enough
[2019-05-07T16:54:18.323Z]	<Lionel_Wolberger>	... 'prvably under the control of the DID controller'
[2019-05-07T16:54:47.372Z]	<Lionel_Wolberger>	... A Hughes ran a session on, what do you do if your DID provider goes out of business, or is just gone
[2019-05-07T16:54:54.130Z]	<Lionel_Wolberger>	... e.g. what if bitcoin disappeared
[2019-05-07T16:55:13.651Z]	<Lionel_Wolberger>	... broke out the system components, what happens if each of these different things was to be shut down
[2019-05-07T16:55:30.528Z]	<Lionel_Wolberger>	... clarified that a big part of decentralization is to tolerate failure
[2019-05-07T16:55:44.116Z]	<kimhd>	ack drummond
[2019-05-07T16:56:16.527Z]	<JoeAndrieu>	OMG... er... OMJ?
[2019-05-07T16:56:22.162Z]	<Lionel_Wolberger>	Drummond: Markus has checked in, this Thursday DID call is ready to go over the rubrics

[2019-05-07T16:58:05.162Z]	<Lionel_Wolberger>	... Project Aries on Hyperledger approved, this breaks off the wallet
[2019-05-07T16:58:34.680Z]	<Lionel_Wolberger>	... impressive demo of using different providers to get a credential to get an email address
[2019-05-07T16:58:49.079Z]	<Lionel_Wolberger>	... could form a direct peer to peer connection in that directory

[2019-05-07T16:59:19.718Z]	<Lionel_Wolberger>	... demo by BC.gov with participation of NZ, street cred
