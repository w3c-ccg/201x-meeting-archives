22:11:00	 From Markus Sabadello : 1. Community governance: issue resolution and closure policies
2. What does it mean to dereference a DID URL?
3. Presentation of the above README: did-url-spec - Decentralized Identifier URL (did-url) Specification as well as the spreadsheet: https://github.com/mwherman2000/did-url-spec/tree/master/src (latest numbered version)

22:13:54	 From Ken Ebert : I have to drop. Thanks everyone.
22:17:22	 From Michael Herman : Q+
22:18:32	 From Drummond Reed : q+
22:18:32	 From Dan Burnett : RFC 3986:  'URI "resolution" is the process of
   determining an access mechanism and the appropriate parameters
   necessary to dereference a URI; this resolution may require several
   iterations.  To use that access mechanism to perform an action on the
   URI's resource is to "dereference" the URI.'
22:21:37	 From Dan Burnett : :)
22:21:39	 From Dan Burnett : :)
22:22:20	 From jonnycrunch : q+
22:23:17	 From Michael Herman : q+
22:26:12	 From Joe : q+
22:27:15	 From Drummond Reed : q+
22:27:33	 From Dan Burnett : q+
22:27:51	 From Drummond Reed : q+
22:30:22	 From Michael Herman : q+
22:30:35	 From Ben Cessa : Would it be sensible to implement the access control mechanism as a separated component from the actual DID resolution? One that can be enabled/disabled by the DID subject if desired?
22:33:22	 From Drummond Reed : is this where we fall into the HTTP 14 rathole?????
22:34:08	 From Drummond Reed : q+
22:34:43	 From jonnycrunch : q+
22:35:56	 From Joe : q+
22:40:35	 From Drummond Reed : q+
22:41:13	 From Dan Burnett : q+ to agree that DID never identifies a DID document and opine that the DID resource is a logical item only such as a DID subject
22:42:13	 From Joe : q+
22:43:07	 From Drummond Reed : q+
22:43:50	 From Dan Burnett : What a DID identifies and what a DID resolves to are not the same thing.
22:44:03	 From Dan Burnett : I think we should stop assuming dereferencing is retrieval
22:45:19	 From Joe : q+
22:45:57	 From jonnycrunch : Didn’t the webID spec ultimately not work out for this reason?  Hence why we are now talking about DIDs and not making the same mistakes.
22:46:38	 From Dan Burnett : I'm still on the queue, I think
22:47:51	 From Drummond Reed : q+
22:50:39	 From Joe : q+
22:52:05	 From Chrisb : would it be helpful to comeback to first principles and remember that one of the most common uses of a DID is to lookup a public key to use for auth or VC signature
22:52:38	 From jonnycrunch : +1 to Dan …  I guess that is why we call it a DID METHOD, because the are methods that performs ‘stuff’ and generates the DID document.
22:52:42	 From Dan Burnett : (chrisb that is probably good for a level set)
22:54:40	 From Dan Burnett : yes, it COULD be an information resource such as a file, but we should not limit ourselves to that.
22:55:26	 From jonnycrunch : or a DID under the control of Alice or her alternate personas or is a bot under her control.
22:55:47	 From Dan Burnett : +1 that action on a DID for a physical resource could be to return a URL for a file
22:55:51	 From Dan Burnett : COULD BE
22:57:27	 From Dan Burnett : I take back what I said about a resource not being a person.  I actually corrected that by giving an example of using a DID action to communicate with a person controlling the DID
22:58:33	 From Drummond Reed : q+
22:59:24	 From Dan Burnett : always resolves to DID doc.  A default dereference action for all DID methods could be *defined* to be returning the DID document
22:59:36	 From Dan Burnett : (DID) always resolves to a DID doc.
23:00:59	 From Dan Burnett : I like Joe's use of the word 'interaction'.  Instead of dereferencing, if we use the term 'interacting with' it will help with understanding
23:03:16	 From Dan Burnett : q+
