[Tue 12:42:18] <drummond>	I would never say it's "just" about key management. But I think key management is a key part (sic) of what DID documents are about.

[Tue 12:42:37] <dlongley>	i think a DID doc is about establishing an independent entity and being able to authenticate that certain activities/actions were performed by that entity -- and to interact with that entity via services.
[Tue 12:42:49] <DavidC>	Manu: we cannot control what people will put in DID docs
[Tue 12:43:27] <DavidC>	Manu: But we have to say how keys, authn and authz are dealt with
[Tue 12:43:43] <JoeAndrieu>	keys are technology specific. there will be other mechanisms in the future. "Authentication" is an attempt to embrace other potential means for vetting actors

[Tue 12:47:15] <drummond>	I agree with Manu that we need to close on the DID spec hardening discussions before we know what the structure of a key description registry will look like.

[Tue 12:48:33] <drummond>	+1 to the overall idea of having a separate key description registry. It's an alternative to the super-structured and heavyweight approach of https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517.
[Tue 12:48:36] <DavidC>	manu: this is straightforward PR. Should not be any objections to it

[Tue 12:54:48] <drummond>	Ok, what I could volunteer to do is do a refresh on the DID spec hardening Google doc to prioritize issues by (what appear to be) easiest to hardest, and then work from easiest to hardest if that will work best.
[Tue 12:54:50] <DavidC>	ChristopherA: can we separate issues into easy topics, ones that need more discussion in January etc.
[Tue 12:55:23] <dlongley>	+1 for easiest to hardest
[Tue 12:55:39] <manu>	+1 to Drummond's proposal... feels like that has the best morale outcome :P
[Tue 12:55:41] <DavidC>	ChristopherA: we need to move DID hardening back to CCG calls
[Tue 12:55:42] <dlongley>	that also gives more time for the harder items to stew and be discussed in other channels

[Tue 12:56:31] <drummond>	Yes, I'm thinking we may want to start moving some of the DID spec hardening issues over to github so we can have dedicated discussion threads about them.

[Tue 12:57:12] <DavidC>	ChristopherA: work items should be chosen by group, and if no discussions within a week, then they should be accepted in the following week
[Tue 12:57:31] <manu>	drummond, I also setup David Chadwick w/ his Github editor stuff, so we could do the same w/ you when you have the time.
[Tue 12:57:42] <kimhd>	+1
[Tue 12:57:44] *	manu missed the two items.
[Tue 12:57:45] <DavidC>	ChristopherA: we are not approving the content, but that it should become a work item
[Tue 12:57:54] <drummond>	Manu: +1 to doing PRs on the issues we've resolved

[Tue 12:59:05] *	drummond I just wish we collectively could bear down and spend significant time to close on all these DID issues so we can get to a hardened spec (what I like to think of as "Implementer’s Draft 02").
[Tue 12:59:23] *	drummond It's my "Christmas wish" ;-)
[Tue 12:59:24] <DavidC>	ChristopherA: the registry doc should be an official work item
[Tue 12:59:45] <DavidC>	Manu: the DID registry and the process document are two further work items
[Tue 13:00:12] *	manu we could do --- PROPOSAL: Adopt Credentials CG Registry process and Linked Data Keys Registry and DID Method Registry as Work Items.
[Tue 13:00:20] <DavidC>	Manu: there are two registries: DID and revocation
