[2018-07-03T16:41:08.531Z]  <drummond>  DIDs are also a decentralized solution to persistent identification of a resource. That has been a longstanding need of the Web as a whole. So when you combine the ability to have persistent identification of a resource with the ability to do public key discovery and verification, all decentralized, DIDs are a major paradigm shift.

This approach may not work in US but probably in Europe due to GDPR. There is an opportunity in the ad industry in which they can serve ads to a confirmed identity. They want it to be known that ads are shown to people that actually have those interests, using verifiable credentials. This conversation will be around converting consumers into their sales funnel. I'm a bit concerned about having that discussion, I just want to be very clear before going into it.

[2018-07-03T16:52:55.766Z]  <Drabiv>  DID vs. centralized IDs – DID will shine where sovereignty (ultimate control over asset + e2ee) is required.
[2018-07-03T16:53:11.118Z]  <gannan>  manu: The thing that jumped out at me is that it's more of an ocap use case. There are many tools that we have that could address those use cases. It could be a ocap use case or a multi-sig use case

[2018-07-03T16:54:05.738Z]  <kimhd> +1 I'd like to see that paper
[2018-07-03T16:54:08.359Z]  <chase> what heather is talking about might be useful for the Guatemala use case, each person can assign an identity as part of their community? I'd love to talk about it more
[2018-07-03T16:54:29.850Z]  <manu>  heathervescent, to be clear -- I think there is a DID use case in there...

[2018-07-03T16:54:44.138Z]  <manu>  heathervescent, like DIDs enable that use case you're talking about...
[2018-07-03T16:54:44.463Z]  <gannan>  heathervescent: Thank you everyone for their comments.

[2018-07-03T16:55:09.062Z]  <heathervescent>  OK, Thanks Manu. I may write up something brief.
[2018-07-03T16:55:14.684Z]  <kimhd> +1 to Manu's comment. I think there is a DID use cases in there AND others (OCAP, etc)
[2018-07-03T16:55:42.158Z]  <ChristopherA>  topic: DID-Auth
[2018-07-03T16:55:45.070Z]  <gannan>  JoeAndrieu: Definitely support a topic paper and potentially a great use case. This might be a good example of leveraging multi-sig.

[2018-07-03T16:57:17.917Z]  <gannan>  markus_sabadello: The paper on DID-Auth is in its final stages, I just wanted to take a snapshot of the community wisdom on DID-Auth.
[2018-07-03T16:57:57.580Z]  <rgrant>  markus_sabadello: is the paper a representation in any way about whether the scenarios are secure?
[2018-07-03T16:58:12.302Z]  <ChristopherA>  q?
[2018-07-03T16:58:18.527Z]  <rgrant>  markus_sabadello: (i.e. does it need review?)
[2018-07-03T16:58:20.222Z]  <gannan>  ChristopherA: One thing we wanted to get from you is what from the DID-Auth paper needs to be worked through as a potential work item in this group. This paper is a good overview of everyone's thoughts. What are some low hanging items we can work on as a group?

[2018-07-03T16:58:52.857Z]  <markus_sabadello>  There's still time for review and comments: https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-spring2018/blob/master/draft-documents/did_auth_draft.md

[2018-07-03T17:00:20.079Z]  <dmitriz> we mention OCap in the paper, fwiw

[2018-07-03T17:00:31.437Z]  <markus_sabadello>  Happy to talk on a seprate call with manu about ocap in DID Auth.

[2018-07-03T17:00:44.777Z]  <gannan>  manu: Skimming paper now, I see a lot of JWT which is concerning. I'm not seeing a lot of OCAP in the paper. We'll chat offline about using OCAP to using authentication, fantastic work on the paper, thank you for putting that together.
[2018-07-03T17:02:47.538Z]  <drummond>  Please note: I will be completely offline at a family reunion in Maine the week of July 9, so I won't be able to attend.
[2018-07-03T17:02:53.967Z]  <gannan>  ChristopherA: I want to get to authorization later, it's very important. Institutions want attestations that a bimoetric was used to open the private key. A particular hardware generation of a key was generated with trusted hardware. That's it for today, next week we may not be able to revisit the Guatemala use case.
[2018-07-03T17:03:26.583Z]  <gannan>  ChristopherA: Coming up on August 7th, proof of personhood. How can we prove that someone is a unique person?
[2018-07-03T17:03:30.779Z]  <heathervescent>  Thanks all. Bye.
