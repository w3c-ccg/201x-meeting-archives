<div onmouseout="$('#link-3').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-3').show()" id="3" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We&apos;re putting this proposal together because a number of people at W3C requested it. This arch doc is here to quickly inform people about the type of arch we&apos;re talking about. I would even go as far to say that our audience for this is technical orgs, specifically members of W3C, or orgs that would become members of W3C if the work takes off. That&apos;s really all the background that we need. <a id="link-3" style="display:none;" href="#3">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-4').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-4').show()" id="4" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Deadline is the 20th. The WPIG is going to review all this stuff. To catch you up on where we are, we&apos;ve been talking about Verifiable Claims, they used to be called Credentials, for about 4 years. This used to be in the Web Payments Community Group. It was later split into its own group at the Credentials Community Group, where it incubated for about 18 months. Then the Web Payments Interest Group, official W3C group, started up and it is responsible for coming up with charters for WGs. VC was taken up by the IG and the VC task force was created to come up with the charter and these other docs and we&apos;re going to give those docs to the IG and have them read it and then ask them if they will take it to W3C membership for a vote. <a id="link-4" style="display:none;" href="#4">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-5').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-5').show()" id="5" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  There&apos;s a F2F on the first of July. <a id="link-5" style="display:none;" href="#5">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-6').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-6').show()" id="6" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  That&apos;s why we have this deadline. <a id="link-6" style="display:none;" href="#6">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-7').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-7').show()" id="7" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Crocker</span>:  This is a hard deadline for getting a group vote on whether to approve the documents in their current form and put it forward to the W3C membership for approval. <a id="link-7" style="display:none;" href="#7">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-8').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-8').show()" id="8" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Crocker</span>:  Just trying to understand the broad strokes of this. Assuming it gets approved, what happens after that? <a id="link-8" style="display:none;" href="#8">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-9').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-9').show()" id="9" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  If approved by IG it goes to W3C management, and they will tell us if they think the membership won&apos;t have any objectives. We may have a roadblock there -- if we get buy in from them and can prove we&apos;ve got consensus over the past 2 years, etc. THen they would put it to a vote by the whole membership 400+ orgs. <a id="link-9" style="display:none;" href="#9">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-10').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-10').show()" id="10" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  There are two thumbs down we could get, one is from management -- that means we haven&apos;t answered some question from them, usually a large member company has an issue they need resolved. <a id="link-10" style="display:none;" href="#10">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-11').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-11').show()" id="11" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Management has been unconvinced twice before but has come back with vague requests. <a id="link-11" style="display:none;" href="#11">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-12').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-12').show()" id="12" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Crocker</span>:  Thanks. I apologize for not doing this homework sooner. <a id="link-12" style="display:none;" href="#12">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-13').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-13').show()" id="13" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  There&apos;s no way for you to know without us having this conversation. <a id="link-13" style="display:none;" href="#13">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-14').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-14').show()" id="14" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Crocker</span>:  I&apos;m trying to figure out a good way for us to navigate here. I have a bunch of questions I&apos;m looking at -- and the stuff I&apos;m looking at has changed dramatically in the past week or two. It&apos;s not good or bad it&apos;s that there are changes. When something changes that much this quickly it means it hasn&apos;t had time to get into people&apos;s brains and discussions for them to know how it will be used. Which strikes me exactly as the issue that these votes are trying to consider. <a id="link-14" style="display:none;" href="#14">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-15').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-15').show()" id="15" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Let me clarify a bit, I don&apos;t believe what we&apos;re proposing in this doc has really changed when it comes to the tribal knowledge in this community. When it comes to what was talked about at the design workshop, that&apos;s where there are differences. <a id="link-15" style="display:none;" href="#15">✪</a></div>
<h1 id="topic-2" class="topic">Topic: Analysis of current document</h1>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-16').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-16').show()" id="16" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Crocker</span>:  Right. I tried to make some annotations on the document that you circulated. We didn&apos;t get around to talking about those. Any example of a very basic question about this question and a previous one... where&apos;s the identity in this? <a id="link-16" style="display:none;" href="#16">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-17').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-17').show()" id="17" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Crocker</span>:  Holder, issuer, inspector, storage location -- where&apos;s the identity? The entity that the claims are being made about is never mention. <a id="link-17" style="display:none;" href="#17">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-18').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-18').show()" id="18" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We&apos;ve been calling it that the subject. <a id="link-18" style="display:none;" href="#18">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-19').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-19').show()" id="19" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  We can get to that question in particular, i have thoughts <a id="link-19" style="display:none;" href="#19">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-20').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-20').show()" id="20" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Crocker</span>:  We have claims that are ... where they come from is clear (the issuer), where they go actually seems less clear. The reason I say that is ... claims go to the holder and are held in the repository. There appeared in the discussions I was around ... upper box currently labeled registry and used to be ledger ... it was a place to go to verify the claims. You could go there to test the accuracy,  not the validity, whether an issuer made the claims can be checked. <a id="link-20" style="display:none;" href="#20">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-21').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-21').show()" id="21" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Let me explain removing the ledger. The W3C is just starting to look at blockchain tech. End of June workshop. If we walked in there with a ledger as part of the architecture, we could get pushback and it&apos;s not a fundamental component of the system. It&apos;s not core to the system. The decentralized identifier system registry is just there for claiming identifiers that you can prove you have ownership over. We tried to narrow the scope of the diagram down to the minimum necessary to bootstrap the ecosystem. For every box and arrow you add it&apos;s potentially another spec and protocol you have to define. <a id="link-21" style="display:none;" href="#21">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-22').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-22').show()" id="22" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Crocker</span>:  The basic simplicity of the architecture I found really appealing. A simpler architecture means we took the time to make it shorter. <a id="link-22" style="display:none;" href="#22">✪</a></div>
<div class="information">Manu Sporny is scribing.</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-23').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-23').show()" id="23" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  I think you mentioned on previous calls - good to have simple diagram to have people consume. Other diagrams might provide more depth/features - other groups of people that want to understand how you break roles down into subroles. For example, holder. <a id="link-23" style="display:none;" href="#23">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-24').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-24').show()" id="24" class="comment"><span class="name">Adam Lake</span>: Lost audio <a id="link-24" style="display:none;" href="#24">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-25').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-25').show()" id="25" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Crocker</span>: Looks like i got disconnected. will call back <a id="link-25" style="display:none;" href="#25">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-26').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-26').show()" id="26" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Holder could be broken down into software agent that moves stuff around. Same thing for requests - single box - single boxes can be broken down into multiple rules. <a id="link-26" style="display:none;" href="#26">✪</a></div>
<h1 id="topic-3" class="topic">Topic: Identifier registry</h1>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-27').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-27').show()" id="27" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Crocker</span>:  So, I think the question I ended on was - decentralized identifier registry, in current version, is really only and exactly an identifier registry, you check it to see if an identifier is registered and to whom. <a id="link-27" style="display:none;" href="#27">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-28').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-28').show()" id="28" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  We have been trying to make the diagram that we present in general to be as simple as possible. There are other things that can break roles down into other pieces that more advanced parties would like to learn about. We have a simple diagram to figure out how information can move around. We could have other architecture diagrams that explain how that works. Where is the identity? Where are the verifiable claims? <a id="link-28" style="display:none;" href="#28">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-29').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-29').show()" id="29" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  You could actually break this down into subject that claim is about, software agent that moves claims around, repository that is a storage abstraction - furthermore, where they might go might break down into software/hardware that you hold onto as a person, or it could be a public blockchain that you use to hold on for public claims, or you use some other mechanisms to store private information. <a id="link-29" style="display:none;" href="#29">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-30').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-30').show()" id="30" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  There are a number of different pieces that are not necessary for core architecture, but very important for solving more use cases and implementing the system. Same thing is true for party that receives claims - that same role, which we&apos;ve called &apos;consumer&apos;, &apos;inspector&apos; could really be a number of subroles... requesting vs. verification of claim. Maybe claim verification can be delegated. <a id="link-30" style="display:none;" href="#30">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-31').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-31').show()" id="31" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Or it could check a whitelist for a bunch of issuers that it trusts, or it could be that issuers can receive stuff from accredicration bodies. we don&apos;t want all of that in the simplest diagram. We have parties that issue credentials, there are parties that control these claims, parties that can request them, and some concept of an identifier that has independent existence - so you have more power/control - store them as you see fit. <a id="link-31" style="display:none;" href="#31">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-32').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-32').show()" id="32" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  All of those things are a part of the core architecture - you could even say you could take out independent existence part and still have the system work (take out Decentralized Identifier Registry). <a id="link-32" style="display:none;" href="#32">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-33').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-33').show()" id="33" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Crocker</span>:  The concept of layering - macro-granuality for one version of arch, and one for smaller-granuality.. we want to make sure macro boxes don&apos;t change as you go down to the micro-version. <a id="link-33" style="display:none;" href="#33">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-34').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-34').show()" id="34" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Crocker</span>:  So, challenge is boxes you have and what labels you have on them. So, for example - registry - for registry and identifiers who own them. <a id="link-34" style="display:none;" href="#34">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-35').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-35').show()" id="35" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Crocker</span>:  Yes, that&apos;s all that it does. is it going to be something else as you add more detail. If it&apos;s going to be something else, then the label is going to be a problem. <a id="link-35" style="display:none;" href="#35">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-36').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-36').show()" id="36" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Crocker</span>:  Saying something like decentralized is an implementation issue - better to have architecture not have implementation details. <a id="link-36" style="display:none;" href="#36">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-37').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-37').show()" id="37" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Another one of these had &quot;oracle&quot; - don&apos;t know if that&apos;s too generic. <a id="link-37" style="display:none;" href="#37">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-38').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-38').show()" id="38" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Crocker</span>:  We came up with Oracle because that box had multiple pieces of functionality - we had functions that were different from the other two. oracle is not a good word, but didn&apos;t have much else to replace it with. Reporter might work. <a id="link-38" style="display:none;" href="#38">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-39').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-39').show()" id="39" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Crocker</span>:  The other one, the more you and others have talked about the Holder, the more I see it as something more than just a holder. The reality is that it is the entity being identified. <a id="link-39" style="display:none;" href="#39">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-40').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-40').show()" id="40" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Most of the time that&apos;s true, but sometimes it is about another subject. <a id="link-40" style="display:none;" href="#40">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-41').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-41').show()" id="41" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Crocker</span>:  I think that&apos;s a striking and useful basis for noting that &quot;identity&quot; - the &quot;identity&quot; being identified is a separate box in the architecture and it ought to be distinguished. I think I understand why that didn&apos;t happen. <a id="link-41" style="display:none;" href="#41">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-42').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-42').show()" id="42" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Crocker</span>:  You can have actors that have different roles at different times. Implementation vs. architecture - two different boxes might be performed by same actor, that&apos;s okay - but they don&apos;t have to be compressed into one box. <a id="link-42" style="display:none;" href="#42">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-43').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-43').show()" id="43" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  The fact that a single player might have multiple roles shouldn&apos;t affect the architecture.  <a id="link-43" style="display:none;" href="#43">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-44').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-44').show()" id="44" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Crocker</span>:  For holder, you have a descriptive tag to say it manages the registry entry. That doesn&apos;t sound like holder to me, it sounds like owner. <a id="link-44" style="display:none;" href="#44">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-45').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-45').show()" id="45" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  We had a certain concept that goes back to self-soverign identity - you&apos;re in control of your own claims. The fact that you might employ software agent to do some of these things. We&apos;re trying to keep this particular architecture as simple as possible trying to tease out those subtle differences. <a id="link-45" style="display:none;" href="#45">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-46').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-46').show()" id="46" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Jsut to quickly why we try to stay away from identity. Very early on we had identity in a number of these documents -- and the response we got back from reviewers was vehement opposition to any work because we were &quot;trying to tackle the identity problem&quot; and W3C absolutely does not want to get involved in that rolling failure that is identity on the Web and the internet.

<div onmouseout="$('#link-47').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-47').show()" id="47" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Crocker</span>:  I do understand the religious wars that go on with that, I used it because I saw &quot;identifier&quot; and that&apos;s an easy term and someone owns that and I used &quot;identity&quot; for that.

<div onmouseout="$('#link-48').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-48').show()" id="48" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  The thing that the verifiable claim is about is the &quot;subject&quot; of those claims.

<div onmouseout="$('#link-49').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-49').show()" id="49" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  But &quot;holder&quot; is a bit different -- there&apos;s a part of the architecture that you haven&apos;t been exposed to yet. One of them is to design a privacy aware architecture, at no point should the issuer or repo know who you&apos;re giving the claim over to.

<div onmouseout="$('#link-50').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-50').show()" id="50" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  At no point should they know that until you have given consent. <a id="link-50" style="display:none;" href="#50">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-51').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-51').show()" id="51" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Crocker</span>:  That&apos;s fine -- but not affected by what we&apos;re discussing. I think that the arch can show this privacy feature. I think that&apos;s a particular bit of insight that someone looking at the arch can tell or not tell.

<div onmouseout="$('#link-53').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-53').show()" id="53" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I wanted to mention the self-sovereign bit is important. There are things we&apos;ve put into the diagram, specifically to demonstrate why this is different from SAML or OpenID Connect.

<div onmouseout="$('#link-54').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-54').show()" id="54" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We have orgs that can issue claims, orgs that can request claims, and all of that stuff is supported in OpenID Connect. Most federated systems today -- they don&apos;t support two things: the concept of a subject of a verifiable claim can exist independently of an IdP. That can be done through decentralized identifiers -- where anyone can claim an identifier and manage it. That&apos;s a core requirement for people to have independent existence. That&apos;s why we don&apos;t have oracle in here. We wanted to get specific about the key differences here.

<div onmouseout="$('#link-62').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-62').show()" id="62" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Crocker</span>:  There can be a third party -- even though all access to the info in the repo is through the holder, a really important point -- you want to highlight that it can be an independent third party.

<div onmouseout="$('#link-65').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-65').show()" id="65" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Crocker</span>:  The same can be said for the inspection function. It can, and I suspect will, to be delegated to an independent third party. [scribe assist by Dave Longley] <a id="link-65" style="display:none;" href="#65">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-66').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-66').show()" id="66" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  I would say that&apos;s true, I would expect there to be a standard way to make a request to a user agent and pass on that request to a user agent that works on behalf of the holder so they can fulfill that request. When you&apos;re talking about the inspector, you&apos;re talking about independent verifiable - standard interface or algorithm that you can run over a credential to determine whether or not something is verified or fails verification. <a id="link-66" style="display:none;" href="#66">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-67').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-67').show()" id="67" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Are you talking about protocols asking to see if something is verified? <a id="link-67" style="display:none;" href="#67">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-68').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-68').show()" id="68" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Crocker</span>:  I was thinking about the latter - 3rd party inspector was standing between the inspector and the party consuming the information - how to model this - better to have this as the entity that&apos;s going to consume the information as being directly connected into the rest of the architecture and rest of the inspection function behind delegated. Just as holder may not want to delegate the function. <a id="link-68" style="display:none;" href="#68">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-73').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-73').show()" id="73" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Crocker</span>:  Fact that the subject is not in here - maybe we can have subject be above registry - one line going to Registry - that will be entity that manages identifier - holder just manages them - arrow from registry to holder - registry from any of the bottom three - needs to go from registry to bottom 3. Issuer, holder, and inspector, all they do is query the registry. <a id="link-73" style="display:none;" href="#73">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-74').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-74').show()" id="74" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Subject, I would argue is not necessary in the diagram, because we don&apos;t really talk about verifiable claims other than having them in the white boxes. I don&apos;t know if having subject helps understand or not. To delegate inspection to a third party is absolutely the same, I&apos;m not convinced that it&apos;s important to point that out. One of the reasons being that the system is designed so that every website receiving this information ... receiving a claim... they can do a simple check on it, and it seems like if they delegate that it requires more complexity. I don&apos;t know if we need to have that discussion at this point. Every box we add we have to depend as being mandatory in the architecture. <a id="link-74" style="display:none;" href="#74">✪</a></div>

You could remove decentralized identifier registry -- but that&apos;s not proposed in the first version of the WG at all. We&apos;re just talking about data model and syntax.
