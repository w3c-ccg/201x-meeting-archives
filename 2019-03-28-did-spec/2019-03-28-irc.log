[2019-03-28T20:20:14.780Z]	<rhiaro>	TOPIC: Update about KNOW
[2019-03-28T20:20:27.282Z]	<rhiaro>	drummond: It was one of the most absorbing conference I've been to in a while, a lot of value
[2019-03-28T20:21:11.885Z]	<rhiaro>	... there was a lot of SSI or decentralized identity interest, in DIDs, roughly 25 or 30 companies with booths and commercial presences, 9 that are specifically in SSI or decentralized space. one that I became aware of who wasn't there who are using DID in the name, DIDx in South Africa
[2019-03-28T20:21:27.935Z]	<rhiaro>	... had a great talk with the team spinning of Spark in NZ a new company to focus entirely on SSI
[2019-03-28T20:21:49.868Z]	<rhiaro>	... A whole bunch of great discussions, and they're very serious about contributing to the open standards and open source communities, want to see NZ become one of the adoption ecosystems for what we're doing in SSI
[2019-03-28T20:22:07.781Z]	<rhiaro>	... A number of conversations advancing around ecosystems and use cases. Getting to the business traction of what we're doing, very encouraging.
[2019-03-28T20:22:13.040Z]	<rhiaro>	... Anyone else who was at KNOW who wants to share?
[2019-03-28T20:22:36.538Z]	<rhiaro>	Isaac: With Bloom(?) We sent a couple of people and had a similar experience. Lots of larger companies taking the idea a lot more seriously
[2019-03-28T20:23:04.444Z]	<rhiaro>	dmitriz: I was know at KNOW but looking on with interest. Do you know anything about the Mastercard press release that they're focussing on SSI?
[2019-03-28T20:23:10.846Z]	<rhiaro>	drummond: I don't have any special insight
[2019-03-28T20:23:46.091Z]	<rhiaro>	... There was an announcement in December from Mastercard and Microsoft about working together in this space. Decentralized identity is the term they use. It was widely anticipated that this was going to be the announcement of the next step, what's real and coming
[2019-03-28T20:23:55.049Z]	<rhiaro>	... I sat through the presentation.. it was an announcement of a whitepaper
[2019-03-28T20:24:26.796Z]	<rhiaro>	... a 26 page white paper. With some nice diagrams, that would be very familiar to people in this group. The Wired article that came out talked about DIDs and ZKPs and appropriate privacy and decentralization but no specifics at all
[2019-03-28T20:24:54.631Z]	<rhiaro>	... One thing I can say is that there were folks associated with Mastercard specifically talking to those of us working on the open standards and SSI networks who wanted to engage. They didn't talk about their announcements, but were specific about setting up calls and discussions
[2019-03-28T20:25:21.303Z]	<rhiaro>	... That's all I can say. It was somewhat befuddling and after that, lunch on the second day, constant discussion the rest of the day and that night about what is really happening. Nobody I know knows for certain
[2019-03-28T20:25:34.881Z]	<rhiaro>	dmitriz: I wanted to confirm whetheri t's our flavour of SSI that they meant. Sounds like yes. Guess we'll wait and see. Thanks
[2019-03-28T20:26:00.351Z]	<rhiaro>	drummond: I received one email from someone close to the space but not directly in it who read the Wired article and saw teh press release and said "I dn't understand they're telling your story and not saying the real names"
[2019-03-28T20:26:19.569Z]	<rhiaro>	... I wish I had more info. I suspect we'll learn more in the next couple weeks
[2019-03-28T20:26:36.446Z]	<rhiaro>	... The next conference coming up I'm aware of that's a milestone is IIW on April 30
[2019-03-28T20:26:46.325Z]	<rhiaro>	... There was some speculation that they wanted to advance to saying something more there
[2019-03-28T20:26:58.867Z]	<rhiaro>	q?
[2019-03-28T20:27:37.744Z]	<rhiaro>	... DKMS a year ago the evernym and some contractors including some folks here had been working on an architecture for DKMS. We did the bulk of that ina  one year period that ended last March and put out a document
[2019-03-28T20:28:08.055Z]	<rhiaro>	... We extended the contract because we wanted to extend the implementations of core functionality. Largely done now. There are code modules there. Not all of it bus significant pieces are now implemented
[2019-03-28T20:28:37.467Z]	<rhiaro>	... One of the things we wanted to do in our final report which is going in tomorrow is approve a v4 version of that document that really incorporates learnings from that code
[2019-03-28T20:28:41.115Z]	<rhiaro>	... We're almost done with that
[2019-03-28T20:29:03.713Z]	<rhiaro>	... We've got a number of the original contributors who are now at Sovrin, and some subcontractors. That's coming out tomorrow. It'll be in hyperledger we'll send out a link, it's public
[2019-03-28T20:29:12.046Z]	<rhiaro>	... Heads up for anyone interested.
[2019-03-28T20:29:17.473Z]	<rhiaro>	... I'll send a link to the list
[2019-03-28T20:29:28.872Z]	<rhiaro>	... Anyone else with an update for the community?
[2019-03-28T20:29:32.927Z]	<VipinSun>	We will discuss on HL ID WG as well
[2019-03-28T20:29:39.373Z]	<rhiaro>	TOPIC: ABNF Discussion
[2019-03-28T20:30:17.390Z]	<rhiaro>	... Given there's been a lot of discussion about the abnf in the resolution call.. there were at least one view that was define a very simple abnf in the main spec and then have a more complex abnf with different resolution functions defined in the resolution spec
[2019-03-28T20:30:38.253Z]	<rhiaro>	... Markus and I were both of the reaction on the list and off list that really there should be an abnf for DIDs like any other URI scheme and then resolution shoudl reference that
[2019-03-28T20:30:45.124Z]	<burn>	DKMS link:  http://bit.ly/dkmsv3
[2019-03-28T20:30:45.125Z]	<rhiaro>	... That overall scheme. And the requirements for DID methods.
[2019-03-28T20:30:50.234Z]	<rhiaro>	... I think that is the prevailing view
[2019-03-28T20:31:05.389Z]	<rhiaro>	... But before we dive into the depth of that, Markus you want to say anything else? Or whether the resolution discussions are different?
[2019-03-28T20:31:20.044Z]	<rhiaro>	markus: my understanding has been that, the main DID spec would define the syntax and the abnf, the DID grammar
[2019-03-28T20:31:32.628Z]	<rhiaro>	... and DID resolution would reference that. Right now in DID resolution there is a copy of the abnf but that would go away
[2019-03-28T20:31:36.967Z]	<rhiaro>	... It would reference the DID spec
[2019-03-28T20:31:50.401Z]	<drummond>	q?
[2019-03-28T20:31:54.169Z]	<rhiaro>	drummond: Anyone else have views on that?
[2019-03-28T20:32:26.132Z]	<rhiaro>	... I just remembered that dmitri had said another option which was potentially a much.. not incluidng some of the parts of the grammar we've been discussing, in a much simpler first step. Did you have further thoughts?
[2019-03-28T20:32:53.478Z]	<rhiaro>	dmitriz: I wanted to propose to the community, given a copule of things.. that there's a lot of confusion around it, and a lot of ways we can go syntax wise. I wonder if it would make sense to not have the DID service reference urls as part of the first iteration of the spec
[2019-03-28T20:33:05.345Z]	<rhiaro>	... So we just talk about the core DID syntax in the spec and maybe as an editors note we talk about the resolution endpoints?
[2019-03-28T20:33:14.310Z]	<rhiaro>	s/resolution endpoints/resolution URLs
[2019-03-28T20:33:18.354Z]	<rhiaro>	... The thing with the; and ! and so on

[2019-03-28T20:34:12.375Z]	<rhiaro>	JoeAndrieu: dmitriz and i discussed this the last couple of days. i do have some issues with this topic but we need to get the delimiters at a minimum into the DID URL. Otherwise people are going to impellment parsers that don't handle how we add service endpoints later. I dont 'think we can fully punt on it

[2019-03-28T20:34:50.745Z]	<rhiaro>	ken: I think if we dno't put something there are going to be people like Sovrin who are already walking down this path and need something to identify and store and resolve those types of linkages to servie endpoints. If we don't put something there we're going to end up with multiple possible paths sometime in the future
[2019-03-28T20:35:18.430Z]	<rhiaro>	markus: what was the problem with the serive names? would we still have service types?

[2019-03-28T20:35:43.520Z]	<rhiaro>	dmitriz: I'm not proposing we don't have a serviceendpoint section in the DID document. I'm saying we postpone the URL rewrite rules that reference the service endpoints
[2019-03-28T20:36:06.966Z]	<rhiaro>	... It sounds like ken and Joe bring up valid critcism that if we don't do it someone else is going to implement it anyway. What's the use case that you're implementing it for?

[2019-03-28T20:36:27.699Z]	<JoeAndrieu>	q+ to mention the undocumented requirement
[2019-03-28T20:37:21.935Z]	<rhiaro>	drummond: The reason to have a complete DID URL syntax.. the use case relative to service endpoint reference is a group of use cases that have been with the different identifier specs I've been working with for 15 years now. It comes down to authors to be able tohave control of persistent references to their work on the internet
[2019-03-28T20:37:55.329Z]	<rhiaro>	... Take an artist, publishing work on the web, that they don't want the links to break. They don't want to be beholden to any intermediary service provider involved in resolution of those links. Let's talk about copyright lifetimes, 50, 100 year periods. You can't guarantee you'll have control over a domain name for that long
[2019-03-28T20:38:09.848Z]	<rhiaro>	... You can't provide guarantees through infrastructure where you can't control the keys
[2019-03-28T20:38:31.559Z]	<rhiaro>	... You can root identifiers to bodies of work, a blog or a portfolio, in a root identifier that they control and can continue to control, with guardians and delgates, pass down with their estate. That's part 1.
[2019-03-28T20:39:04.828Z]	<rhiaro>	... The other thing I have now seen and continue to see the case grow for is the third option of resoluiton that really began deeply discussing in Barcelona at RWOT8, ken and I wrote up a paper on it and evolved that slowly on a deeper paper
[2019-03-28T20:39:08.743Z]	<rhiaro>	... That's what we call content referencing

[2019-03-28T20:39:19.912Z]	<rhiaro>	... We talk about service referencing, but content referencing is just as important or even more immediate
[2019-03-28T20:39:47.762Z]	<rhiaro>	... We're talking about referencing content on a distributed network, typically immutable, that's not a DID Document. The naked DID is referencable to a DID Doc, but what if you want to reference a different kind of content
[2019-03-28T20:39:54.842Z]	<rhiaro>	... It can be any kind of system defined for immutability
[2019-03-28T20:40:10.691Z]	<rhiaro>	... we're generically calling this content references, specifically DID content references. You can use the DID to resolve the content reference

[2019-03-28T20:40:29.337Z]	<rhiaro>	... ken's use case is schema defintiision, registries, crypto primitives on any Indy based ledger

[2019-03-28T20:42:19.014Z]	<rhiaro>	JoeAndrieu: I want to ack the many conversations at RWOT8 about this. What distilled for me, and it's slightly different form what drummond described, is the unique use case that this supports. A lot o fthe use cases you mentioned, especially in terms of a piece of art or a body of work. A DID for everything. I don't imagine that the Mona Lisa needs a whole hierarchy, the Mona Lisa would have a DID. Whatw as distilled for me was where you have a
[2019-03-28T20:42:19.014Z]	<rhiaro>	large and arbitrary body of content that you want to be able to refer to in a mobile fashion
[2019-03-28T20:42:38.052Z]	<rhiaro>	... So you have a file/folder system and a bunch of files you've organised, like a dropbox, and you want yoru URLs that refer to dropbox to move to another provider
[2019-03-28T20:42:50.091Z]	<rhiaro>	... If the root is a DID then the path into the hierarchical structure it would be useful to be able to reuse that

[2019-03-28T20:43:18.160Z]	<rhiaro>	... I think that's the only use case. I think you can have individual pieces of artowkr that have their own service endpoint, or you could have separate DIDs and achieve the mobility you're talkinga bout. It's really the large and arbitrary set of assests that I think is a unique use case
[2019-03-28T20:43:54.889Z]	<burn>	ack jonathan_holt
[2019-03-28T20:43:56.908Z]	<rhiaro>	jonathan_holt: the way we solved it is with the CID, content addressable storage, in IPLD. We work on the schema rather than consensus about the namespacing about the URLs and what the service endpoints sould be named, we built it intrisincally into the system so it's future proof
[2019-03-28T20:43:57.028Z]	<drummond>	I note that there was a paper submitted to Rebooting the Web of Trust #8 called "A DID for Everything" https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot8-barcelona/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/A-DID-for-every-thing---Agile-Driving-Data-Chain.md

[2019-03-28T20:44:48.854Z]	<rhiaro>	ken: I echo the sentiments of Joe and drummond around moving a collectoin fo items that need portability where they're stored, and consistency in their addressing. The second use case is around the hierarchy of elements in creating a cryptographically assured credential
[2019-03-28T20:45:06.682Z]	<rhiaro>	... we want those to be stored in the namespace in a way that you can consistently get at them. They're readily available and immutable. The naming convention there helps us achieve all of those goals
[2019-03-28T20:45:27.455Z]	<rhiaro>	... Encoding methods, mapping functions, credential defintisions, schemas, presentation definitions, that allow us to achieve that goal. We need some methodology of referencing those content objects

[2019-03-28T20:46:20.010Z]	<rhiaro>	markus: I was not in Barcelona so I missed some of this. My initial reaction is that I was wondering if the fragment could not be used for that. But the fragment is used for identifying parts of the DID Document. My next question is why can't we use the path? A naked DID followed by a path, isn't path in a URI meant to identify some resource in the scope of the URI's authority?

[2019-03-28T20:46:54.356Z]	<jonathan_holt>	+1 I like path. We use it for IPLD
[2019-03-28T20:47:03.440Z]	<rhiaro>	drummond: Potentially it could. One reason for the content referencing proposal we came up with in Barcelona was to enable the reuse of existing standards for content addressing
[2019-03-28T20:47:08.186Z]	<rhiaro>	... To have that be one of the options
[2019-03-28T20:47:17.901Z]	<rhiaro>	... Those formats such as hashlink have their own syntax which appears to be fairly easy for us to adapt
[2019-03-28T20:47:28.085Z]	<rhiaro>	... but to adapt within the component we control the defintion of which is the authority component of the URI
[2019-03-28T20:47:55.191Z]	<rhiaro>	... we could.. as soon as you go into defining things in the path query or fragment components you end up having to step on or work around or come up with rules for all the devs who want to use those components in the ways of other web architectures
[2019-03-28T20:48:04.536Z]	<rhiaro>	... I advocate for doing the innovation part of DIDs in the authority component
[2019-03-28T20:48:19.127Z]	<rhiaro>	... Ironically I think the thinking has advanced quite a bit in terms of how to do that in some ways that are fairly elegant and very powerful and extensible
[2019-03-28T20:48:34.785Z]	<rhiaro>	... I was really hoping a few of these calls can develop a proposal we can get to a good place in the month of April

[2019-03-28T20:48:42.363Z]	<rhiaro>	... I expect we'll continue to talk about it on the DID resolution call
[2019-03-28T20:49:08.773Z]	<rhiaro>	... The path on the naked DID, if there is no indication that it involves a particular service endpoint it might be that a path is okay. A query or fragment could be used as well. THere may be an advantage of using the authority component
[2019-03-28T20:49:26.611Z]	<rhiaro>	JoeAndrieu: A point of clarification - the content addressable thing uses the authority part rather than the path or query to identify the body of work?
[2019-03-28T20:50:14.649Z]	<rhiaro>	drummond: the proposal was that we have syntaxes for doing it like hashlink. What if you could essentially appenda  hashlink to a naked DID so that you had a starting point for resolution for maintaining those references or for resolving that reference on that system
[2019-03-28T20:50:49.078Z]	<rhiaro>	.. that would reuse the benefits of hashlink. That's a pretty easy syntax to support basically all we need is a delimiter char. The hashlink URI or any other content addressing system already has all the syntax it needs and we wouldn't run into escaping problems
[2019-03-28T20:51:55.270Z]	<drummond>	q?
[2019-03-28T20:51:55.789Z]	<jonathan_holt>	q+ so the DID is the authority? Or is it the DID doc?
[2019-03-28T20:51:56.264Z]	<rhiaro>	JoeAndrieu: That sounds awesome and I need to read teh proposal. The root of my concern with the proposal of the aggregating the path and query parameters is because a service endpoint can have path an dquery parameters. The service name is going to be stable much longer than the service endpoint. So I can point to the version of me at the serivce name of social network. So the URL that is the service endpoint in the DID Doc may or may not have path
[2019-03-28T20:51:56.264Z]	<rhiaro>	and query parameters. If they're in the URL we have to resolve two sets of path and query params
[2019-03-28T20:52:20.702Z]	<rhiaro>	... If we can address the use case of large body of work, if we can move that into the content addressable network, that gives us an opportunity to have some simpler rules about not using the path and query params to similar effect
[2019-03-28T20:52:24.134Z]	<drummond>	Q?
[2019-03-28T20:52:24.902Z]	<rhiaro>	... That sounds promising
[2019-03-28T20:52:32.517Z]	<JoeAndrieu>	ack JoeAndrieu
[2019-03-28T20:52:32.550Z]	<Zakim>	JoeAndrieu, you wanted to talk about fragment & path scope
[2019-03-28T20:52:44.943Z]	<rhiaro>	q+ agropper
[2019-03-28T20:53:03.255Z]	<burn>	ack jonathan_holt
[2019-03-28T20:53:08.109Z]	<rhiaro>	jonathan_holt: so the DID the authority or is it the DID doc?
[2019-03-28T20:53:14.030Z]	<rhiaro>	... In this URL scheme, which is sthe authority?
[2019-03-28T20:53:34.062Z]	<rhiaro>	drummond: When I use the authority component I'm talking about a subcomponent of the DID URL and that's the term authority is from the RFC3986 abnf
[2019-03-28T20:53:56.113Z]	<rhiaro>	... the portion before the start of a path or query or fragment. Anything before those things in an absolute URI is called the authority component. Any relative URI does not have an authority component
[2019-03-28T20:53:59.876Z]	<burn>	q+ to show how queue reminders work
[2019-03-28T20:54:01.918Z]	<rhiaro>	... that's what I'm talking about wheN i use that term
[2019-03-28T20:54:02.665Z]	<burn>	ack burn
[2019-03-28T20:54:02.699Z]	<Zakim>	burn, you wanted to show how queue reminders work
[2019-03-28T20:54:11.467Z]	<rhiaro>	... It depends on the defintion that component
[2019-03-28T20:54:28.247Z]	<burn>	q+ to jump up and down excitedly (another example of queue reminder function)
[2019-03-28T20:54:30.824Z]	<burn>	ack burn
[2019-03-28T20:54:30.865Z]	<Zakim>	burn, you wanted to jump up and down excitedly (another example of queue reminder function)
[2019-03-28T20:54:34.082Z]	<rhiaro>	jonathan_holt: who is the authority? the did document or the person providing the DID Document?
[2019-03-28T20:55:00.443Z]	<rhiaro>	... it's about trusting the resolver to produce the correct document. you're now querying on the returned document the standardised path that would parse the did document and produce work from that document if I understand correctly
[2019-03-28T20:55:20.823Z]	<rhiaro>	drummond: the full scenario you just described, the authority for the DID Doc woudl be the DID subject.. are we using the term DID controller?
[2019-03-28T20:55:29.342Z]	<rhiaro>	JoeAndrieu: there are use cases for subject that are not for controller, yes
[2019-03-28T20:55:57.271Z]	<rhiaro>	drummond: the DID controller is who the URI spec woulds ay is the authority. When you include a service reference the controlle ris the authority for the resolution fo the DID, then it's goign to get mapped to a service endpoint and your'e invovling a different authority for that portion of the resolution
[2019-03-28T20:55:59.538Z]	<drummond>	Q?
[2019-03-28T20:56:29.657Z]	<rhiaro>	agropper: double check to Joe's point about the encoding for the abnf - our principle use case is that the DID will lead to a service endpoint that is an authorisation server. I want to double check that what Joe said applies to our use case?
[2019-03-28T20:57:01.081Z]	<rhiaro>	JoeAndrieu: Is the DID URL that you're referirng to externally, does it have path and query components, or is it the service endpoint in the DID Document that has path and query components?
[2019-03-28T20:57:28.571Z]	<rhiaro>	agropper: I want to identify myself by my service endpoint. To use the DID method to prove control of that identifier, instead of using an email for example, and then make sure that it's a pointer to my authorisation server wherever I want it to be
[2019-03-28T20:58:11.634Z]	<rhiaro>	JoeAndrieu: we didn't quite get to it but if the content addressable stuff can move to the authority part there's not a large role in the DID URL itself for path and query. But you can still point to a service endpoint with a service name in the DID URL that can get to a service endpoint in the DID Document which can have path an dquery, which can go to a URL including a ?? service endpoint
[2019-03-28T20:58:15.750Z]	<drummond>	q?
[2019-03-28T20:58:22.168Z]	<rhiaro>	ack agropper
[2019-03-28T20:58:36.269Z]	<rhiaro>	drummond: excellent discussion. We're narrowing down.
[2019-03-28T20:59:24.681Z]	<rhiaro>	... What I'm thinking is we need to close the loop or finish the work that started in Barcelona nd continued in discussions at the VC WG meeting. What i'd like to do is take volunteers who want to say they're willing over the next week to participate on list in a thread where we are boiling down the proposal that came up
[2019-03-28T20:59:33.882Z]	<rhiaro>	... I'd love to in next week's call have a draft or proposal on the abnf that does unify this
[2019-03-28T20:59:37.933Z]	<rhiaro>	... we can talk about it further on the next call
[2019-03-28T21:00:03.662Z]	<rhiaro>	... a couple of open questions. If we can do that on list, async, over the next week, I will have more time next week to help with this. We can come into next week's call with a proposal. People can come in with questions and have a good discussion around that
[2019-03-28T21:00:16.424Z]	<rhiaro>	... If we can get to something we feel good about we can start to tackle the nitty grityt details we need to specify. Thoughts?
[2019-03-28T21:00:22.123Z]	<rhiaro>	JoeAndrieu: sounds good to me
[2019-03-28T21:00:24.390Z]	<rhiaro>	dmitriz: sounds good
[2019-03-28T21:00:39.990Z]	<rhiaro>	drummond: feel free to say in irc too
[2019-03-28T21:00:45.781Z]	<yancy>	i'm willing to be included in the discussion
[2019-03-28T21:00:52.942Z]	<JoeAndrieu>	+1 to discuss on list to advance a proposal
[2019-03-28T21:00:53.450Z]	<ken>	I would like to be included
[2019-03-28T21:00:54.414Z]	<burn>	same here
[2019-03-28T21:01:15.104Z]	<rhiaro>	... We're at time. I'd like to work with rhiaro and manu.. anyone who is interested in besides the ABNF what are the other open issues we want to prioritise on this call
[2019-03-28T21:01:29.095Z]	<jonathan_holt>	MIME types
[2019-03-28T21:01:34.071Z]	<rhiaro>	... I'm thinking most of the next call might go into the ABNF but what are the other things we need to be talkinga bout in the first half of april so we're nailing things down in the second half
[2019-03-28T21:01:35.076Z]	<drummond>	Q?
[2019-03-28T21:01:37.636Z]	<rhiaro>	... mime types is a good one
[2019-03-28T21:01:41.546Z]	<rhiaro>	... I think our q is empty and our itme is up
[2019-03-28T21:01:51.479Z]	<rhiaro>	====================================================
