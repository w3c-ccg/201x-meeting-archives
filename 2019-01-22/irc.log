[2019-01-22T17:14:05.878Z]	<rhiaro>	... Some things I wanted to show in terms of continuing cleanup.. after this week we'll be able to do most iteration in the background
[2019-01-22T17:14:12.806Z]	<rhiaro>	... But key changes:
[2019-01-22T17:14:25.792Z]	<kimhd>	org: https://github.com/w3c-ccg
[2019-01-22T17:14:35.402Z]	<rhiaro>	... In the w3c ccg github organisation, for work items that we've accepted we create repos
[2019-01-22T17:14:54.133Z]	<rhiaro>	... some issues around the creation of them and standardisation, I realised a lot of things were in different states. I've been going around attempting to clean them up and document
[2019-01-22T17:15:00.231Z]	<rhiaro>	... things that need to be addressed
[2019-01-22T17:15:09.566Z]	<kimhd>	ocap-ld repo: https://github.com/w3c-ccg/ocap-ld
[2019-01-22T17:15:10.637Z]	<rhiaro>	... eg. The OCAP-LD
[2019-01-22T17:15:29.127Z]	<rhiaro>	... if you look in that structure, I want to draw attention to some standard files that we should be creating for you when you have a work item
[2019-01-22T17:15:34.242Z]	<rhiaro>	... This is a comment and also a request for feedback
[2019-01-22T17:15:44.691Z]	<rhiaro>	... There's this code owners file, for identifying who are the owners of the work item
[2019-01-22T17:15:55.128Z]	<rhiaro>	... The file is basically used so that if someone creates a PR then these people will be automatically assigned
[2019-01-22T17:16:17.111Z]	<rhiaro>	... You don't need to do this, this file will be created for you when you request your work item you'll identify owners and charis will take care of this part
[2019-01-22T17:16:39.546Z]	<rhiaro>	... If there become additional owners to add or take advantage of some of the more advanced code owners features, or you don't know what's going on, reach out to me
[2019-01-22T17:16:48.379Z]	<rhiaro>	... A file we're missing is the contributing file. That talks about the contribution policy
[2019-01-22T17:17:12.193Z]	<rhiaro>	... I think it's important we add this by default. I helps to put it in people's faces more readily when they submit a PR
[2019-01-22T17:17:16.806Z]	<rhiaro>	... You don't have to add it, the chairs will do it.
[2019-01-22T17:17:24.593Z]	<rhiaro>	... This is helping ot put the IP policy in people's awareness when they contribute
[2019-01-22T17:17:38.216Z]	<rhiaro>	... License was missing on some. It's the W3C software and document license
[2019-01-22T17:17:41.908Z]	<rhiaro>	... Readme is a default file
[2019-01-22T17:17:46.127Z]	<rhiaro>	... index.html is the spec text
[2019-01-22T17:17:59.488Z]	<rhiaro>	... Any questions?
[2019-01-22T17:17:59.488Z]	<kimhd>	q?
[2019-01-22T17:18:55.910Z]	<rhiaro>	... When we've been talking about the DID resolution contributions, at this point, the creator or owner of the work item doesn't need to care about the IIP policy. The combination of these files and the licensing covers making sure people are aware of the policy, so that work item owners don't need to make additional effort in the context of their repo
[2019-01-22T17:19:02.952Z]	<rhiaro>	... speak up if you disagree with that
[2019-01-22T17:19:19.096Z]	<rhiaro>	... Github topics; one other thing is that on each repo, eg. on OCAP-LD at the top you'll see 'topics'
[2019-01-22T17:19:34.174Z]	<rhiaro>	... a 'work item' one, a 'w3c cg' one. Chairs are using these to categorise say work items vs registries.
[2019-01-22T17:19:54.206Z]	<rhiaro>	... if you have strong feedback we can update these
[2019-01-22T17:20:17.310Z]	<rhiaro>	... Lastly, I want to show.. last week we talked about the process of creating a new work item
[2019-01-22T17:20:25.378Z]	<rhiaro>	... there was feedback that it was a lot to take in
[2019-01-22T17:20:35.988Z]	<rhiaro>	... I want to draw attention to.. I have some screengrabs

[2019-01-22T17:22:04.036Z]	<rhiaro>	... That's it for getting everyone up to speed with what's been going on
[2019-01-22T17:22:09.236Z]	<rhiaro>	... There's going to be a lot of stuff going on in the background
[2019-01-22T17:22:30.138Z]	<rhiaro>	... As we did the cleanup I noticed that there were ones where it wasn't clear where they were in the pipeline. We won't on an ongoing basis be taking time in the calls to cover that
[2019-01-22T17:22:37.127Z]	<rhiaro>	... Expect the chairs to reach out to you
[2019-01-22T17:22:56.831Z]	<rhiaro>	... One other thing I want to remind people of - if you look in the work item status

[2019-01-22T17:23:30.114Z]	<rhiaro>	... On that page note that this is what we reviewed last week, look under current work items, those are going to be changing a lot in the next few weeks, this is a good page to look at if you want to know the status of things
[2019-01-22T17:23:45.101Z]	<rhiaro>	... If you want to be more involved in the group, we'll be calling out opportunities
[2019-01-22T17:23:50.227Z]	<rhiaro>	... anything that says 'needs spec text' is a good way to get involved
[2019-01-22T17:23:57.231Z]	<rhiaro>	... We have a training guide on that

[2019-01-22T17:24:35.882Z]	<rhiaro>	... Joe proposed an idea of a spec-a-thon if people want to gather, if they ahve questions about text generation to get on a call, make it a working session so people can learn and unblock 'needs spec text' items
[2019-01-22T17:25:06.556Z]	<rhiaro>	... some like the DID Primer.. I need to update that one.. there's something else like the registry process maybe.. they're ready to move on to be closed after being converted to spec text
[2019-01-22T17:25:12.832Z]	<rhiaro>	... that would be a really good way to advance items
[2019-01-22T17:25:19.233Z]	<rhiaro>	... Reach out on the mailing list if you're interested

[2019-01-22T17:29:56.209Z]	<rhiaro>	... there is a check. A week goes by and there are no objections, but the chairs may decide to wait a bit longer

[2019-01-22T17:30:37.955Z]	<rhiaro>	... First is DID resolutions
[2019-01-22T17:31:04.527Z]	<rhiaro>	markus_sabadello: dmitriz and I have been working on a document for specifying DID resolutions for a while. There is an existing repo
[2019-01-22T17:31:22.266Z]	<rhiaro>	... we think it makes sense to have a separate spec for that. There is a lot of community interest. The document has a bit of initial structure, a number of topics and sections
[2019-01-22T17:31:49.354Z]	<rhiaro>	... Covers topics such as resolver architecture, what does it mean to have a hosted resolver as opposed to in an app or browser; what are input parameters to DID resolution; what is its potential output
[2019-01-22T17:32:06.516Z]	<rhiaro>	... Talks about things like service selection, service endpoint construction, caching, verisoning, revocation and other things that affect the resolution process
[2019-01-22T17:32:14.636Z]	<rhiaro>	... Quite a few people have expressed interest in this being a work item
[2019-01-22T17:32:17.528Z]	<manu>	+1 for it being a work item
[2019-01-22T17:32:25.051Z]	<rhiaro>	... dmitri and I thought we would send out information on how to contribute
[2019-01-22T17:32:36.208Z]	<rhiaro>	... We'll make a proposal. There are some issues already with some good discussion points
[2019-01-22T17:33:00.947Z]	<rhiaro>	... One question would be what will be the delination between DID resolution and the main DID spec. THere are some issues on the main spec that would be more appropriate for DID resolution. We'll figure this out.
[2019-01-22T17:33:05.101Z]	<manu>	+1 for moving DID Resolution specific issues in the DID Spec repo to the DID Resolution repo.
[2019-01-22T17:33:29.447Z]	<manu>	q+ to support work in general and discuss implementations.
[2019-01-22T17:33:51.088Z]	<markus_sabadello>	Current version with basic proposal structure and scope: https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-resolution/
[2019-01-22T17:34:00.031Z]	<rhiaro>	kimhd: For this topic, there will be quite a bit of interest and it will definitely need some break out sessions. These we'll probably do in a similar manner to the did hardening process. The timing and cadence of those can be figured out over time. What we would do for sure is follow a similar process where we're still scribing and recording everything, with IP protection etc
[2019-01-22T17:34:15.290Z]	<rhiaro>	... If you're interested in participating in the DID resolution spec, please let us know through the mailing list or reaching out directly

[2019-01-22T17:34:26.627Z]	<rhiaro>	manu: +1 to support the work. A number of the companies in work depends on there being some kind of resolution spec
[2019-01-22T17:34:59.786Z]	<rhiaro>	... The quesiton I have is around implementation - we have a couple floating around, the DID io implemntaiton that DB has done can do Veres One resolution and we want to add Sovrin resolution and any other did method that seems like it's getitng traction
[2019-01-22T17:35:15.741Z]	<rhiaro>	... That raises the question about test suites, is it a data model only spec, is it an API..
[2019-01-22T17:35:32.175Z]	<rhiaro>	... We already have multiple implementations, I'm wondering how soon the test suite stuff might start as a result of that
[2019-01-22T17:36:00.236Z]	<rhiaro>	markus_sabadello: Not sure I understood. When we'll have test suites?
[2019-01-22T17:36:21.413Z]	<rhiaro>	manu: One of the thing you end up creating to go with a spec is a test suite, and the question is what would the test suite look like. Or do you feel like there's plenty of spec work here?
[2019-01-22T17:36:36.819Z]	<rhiaro>	... if you're working on a data model spec the test suite will look very different than if you're working an http api binding and a data model
[2019-01-22T17:36:51.949Z]	<rhiaro>	... are you trying to do something with a broader scope; a data model for requests and resolvers in addition to an http binding
[2019-01-22T17:37:31.082Z]	<rhiaro>	markus_sabadello: definitely both, there are some things on the data model side. The primary DID data model is still in the main DID spec, not in DID resolution. but I think there would be some additional data model concepts specific to DID resolution, particularly to do with versioning and caching, we'd define additions to the data model
[2019-01-22T17:37:49.349Z]	<rhiaro>	... but we'd also define APIs. An abstract definition for DID resolution functions, an abstract API and then there could be bindings such as an HTTP binding
[2019-01-22T17:37:55.279Z]	<rhiaro>	... we could have test suites for all of those things
[2019-01-22T17:38:16.927Z]	<rhiaro>	... Are test suites a separate work item?
[2019-01-22T17:38:19.331Z]	<manu>	q+
[2019-01-22T17:38:26.830Z]	<kimhd>	ack manu
[2019-01-22T17:38:32.439Z]	<rhiaro>	manu: Typically the test suite is ina  different repo but it's bound to the work
[2019-01-22T17:39:01.481Z]	<rhiaro>	... At some point if it's going to go standards track, you need a test suite. Starting the test suite before the WG is a pretty strong indication that it's fairly well thought out, especially if you can show two implementations
[2019-01-22T17:39:04.798Z]	<dlongley>	spec needs a test suite w/two independent implementations to get to Recommendation status at W3C
[2019-01-22T17:39:06.827Z]	<rhiaro>	... It's a part of the work item, but a different reposityr
[2019-01-22T17:39:19.538Z]	<rhiaro>	markus_sabadello: Then let's do it, I know there are 4 or 5 different projects implementing DID resolution, there's a list
[2019-01-22T17:39:29.402Z]	<rhiaro>	... They're far enough that we could work on test suites, that's a great idea
[2019-01-22T17:39:48.979Z]	<rhiaro>	kimhd: I can start the repo for that. In the kick off calls there will be discusison about breaking up that work
[2019-01-22T17:40:03.001Z]	<rhiaro>	... Expect a followup email to reiterate the kick off of DID resolution
[2019-01-22T17:40:09.760Z]	<rhiaro>	... Next: Functional Identity
[2019-01-22T17:40:14.867Z]	<JoeAndrieu>	https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot6-santabarbara/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/functional-identity-primer.md
[2019-01-22T17:40:15.379Z]	<kimhd>	Functional Identity: https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/53
[2019-01-22T17:40:30.057Z]	<rhiaro>	JoeAndrieu: The goal of this is to pull in the work on the functional identity primer from RWOT
[2019-01-22T17:40:39.258Z]	<rhiaro>	... Get feedback from the CCG. Iterate as necessary. Hopefully get it published as a Note
[2019-01-22T17:40:44.954Z]	<rhiaro>	... The functional identity approach has three components
[2019-01-22T17:41:10.488Z]	<rhiaro>	... The first is to ask folks to talk about identity from a functional perspective. How we use it, rather than the political aspects
[2019-01-22T17:41:21.428Z]	<rhiaro>	... The second is a definition of identity. The definition from ISO is not functional
[2019-01-22T17:41:31.612Z]	<rhiaro>	... It has some interesting complications
[2019-01-22T17:41:56.890Z]	<rhiaro>	... The third part is 10 terms that we've defined, 5 nouns and 5 verbs, assets and processes, to get it into our conversation in the CCG, and publish it for guidence that could have wider reach
[2019-01-22T17:42:06.234Z]	<rhiaro>	kimhd: Any comments or questions?
[2019-01-22T17:42:37.332Z]	<rhiaro>	... Last one: a CCG survey
[2019-01-22T17:43:10.012Z]	<rhiaro>	heathervescent: I think this was a bit of cleanup from the survey that I'm currently conducting with Karen on end of year feedback on CCG
[2019-01-22T17:43:12.694Z]	<heathervescent>	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XqHHCpWg7ZlWqLMjHTkIjhu_lQHEF9ZF1cNUDRVkMbg/edit
[2019-01-22T17:43:30.230Z]	<rhiaro>	... Probably a lot of you have already taken the survey and this is just following the process so it's accepted as an actual work item
[2019-01-22T17:43:59.208Z]	<rhiaro>	kimhd: Oh I thought you had a proposed new one.. is this the existing one?
[2019-01-22T17:44:22.973Z]	<rhiaro>	heathervescent: In the discussion about having participation in the feedback survey I had this idea that we could do one for a broader audience and I don't know if I want to sign up for that
[2019-01-22T17:44:28.981Z]	<rhiaro>	kimhd: that's fair
[2019-01-22T17:44:47.733Z]	<rhiaro>	heathervescent: I think it was getting ahead of itself a little bit, maybe we shoudl focus on this survey, the one that's in progress right now, until the end of this month
[2019-01-22T17:44:49.532Z]	<drabiv>	q+ question about hashlink
[2019-01-22T17:45:00.229Z]	<rhiaro>	... It's not an inconsequential amount of work, it's a piece of research
[2019-01-22T17:45:00.401Z]	<manu>	+1 for focusing on the current survey.
[2019-01-22T17:45:03.199Z]	<rhiaro>	... There's going to be analysis and a report
[2019-01-22T17:45:26.148Z]	<rhiaro>	... We're going to have plenty of feedback from that. I'm not sure if it's useful to get a broader look at things right now
[2019-01-22T17:45:56.461Z]	<rhiaro>	... I'd be happy to do it, it's just will we be able to take action? This community takes technical action, it doesn't take action on the non-technical adoption or education in this space
[2019-01-22T17:46:02.062Z]	<rhiaro>	... is my understanding
[2019-01-22T17:46:16.566Z]	<manu>	q+ to focusing on broader topics if we have people intererested.
[2019-01-22T17:46:35.190Z]	<rhiaro>	kimhd: Yes, so I think possibly.. right the end of year survey, that should have been work item 2, you already have the information supplied for that, it's in process
[2019-01-22T17:46:50.626Z]	<rhiaro>	... I'll update our bookkeeping step on that to note it's already underway. The follow up one, we'll put that on the back burner
[2019-01-22T17:46:55.029Z]	<rhiaro>	... This is a lot of work for now
[2019-01-22T17:47:04.153Z]	<rhiaro>	... This one already is a work item
[2019-01-22T17:47:15.359Z]	<rhiaro>	heathervescent: That was my understanding, it was housekeeping because this survey came ad-hoc
[2019-01-22T17:47:36.988Z]	<rhiaro>	... Not everyone was on that call, the survey was the right way to get feedback. Then, scope creep..
[2019-01-22T17:48:12.957Z]	<rhiaro>	kimhd: To your point about focussing on technical items, I think we would like to be better at other aspects, but point taken that we show up more on the technical space than others. If anyone else on the call would like ot get more involved in that, it would benefit the community greatly.
[2019-01-22T17:48:24.427Z]	<rhiaro>	... it's just up to us now to get the bookkeeping correct. Please fill out the survey if you haven't already
[2019-01-22T17:48:36.195Z]	<rhiaro>	drabiv: I have a quesiton about hashlink spec

[2019-01-22T17:48:50.633Z]	<rhiaro>	... I think it's a great specification, and strange it didn't exist earlier
[2019-01-22T17:49:11.599Z]	<rhiaro>	... My question is how to implement this specification in practice, in particular when we create hash of the resource, how to know what needs to be hashed?
[2019-01-22T17:49:28.701Z]	<rhiaro>	... There is no explanation where the content the resource returns starts
[2019-01-22T17:49:31.349Z]	<manu>	https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sporny-hashlink-02
[2019-01-22T17:49:32.056Z]	<samchase>	present+
[2019-01-22T17:50:03.347Z]	<rhiaro>	... The second question about hashlink maybe we can add to the spec, how to locally store content. In metadata we can add links, but no example how to reference locally stored data
[2019-01-22T17:50:26.352Z]	<rhiaro>	manu: That makes me happy, the hashlink spec was partially written for you, from use cases in the VCWG
[2019-01-22T17:50:49.515Z]	<rhiaro>	... The answer to what do you hash is basically the content that's returned to you. When you do an HTTP GET the data stream that you get back, not the HTTP headers, the actual data blob, that's the thing that is hashed
[2019-01-22T17:50:56.313Z]	<rhiaro>	... There are other things you can put in the hashlink description like the content type
[2019-01-22T17:51:00.766Z]	<rhiaro>	... It's meant to be super simple
[2019-01-22T17:51:12.227Z]	<rhiaro>	... You've got a URL. you GET the URL, and the raw byte stream you get back is what you hash to make sure it matches
[2019-01-22T17:51:31.307Z]	<rhiaro>	drabiv: I think it's goign to be a long conversation, I will write an email
[2019-01-22T17:51:35.955Z]	<rhiaro>	manu: Happy to add stuff to the spec
[2019-01-22T17:51:36.661Z]	<kimhd>	q?
[2019-01-22T17:51:41.707Z]	<rhiaro>	... We can follow up on the mailing list
[2019-01-22T17:51:46.187Z]	<kimhd>	ack manu
[2019-01-22T17:51:49.107Z]	<dmitriz>	manu: is there a repo that goes with the spec?
[2019-01-22T17:52:01.506Z]	<rhiaro>	manu: In response to heather. +1 to focussing on the narrower end of year thing and not expanding scope yet
[2019-01-22T17:52:13.359Z]	<rhiaro>	... We can do a second survey later. I agree with all the rationale.
[2019-01-22T17:52:41.095Z]	<heathervescent>	q+
[2019-01-22T17:52:50.348Z]	<rhiaro>	... The other question.. I heard two things. Joe said it and Heather and Kim said it.. what we focus on in this group is the technical stuff... it's somewhat true but we do want to change that. We do want to focus on educaiton and outreach and how we get the message out, otherwise we're just naval gazing and not doing the right type of out reach
[2019-01-22T17:53:19.634Z]	<rhiaro>	... some of that happens at RWOT, some at TPAC, but primarily we're focussed on the technical topics, but we shouldn't lose sight that there are other community members that would probably be more interested in doing the non-technical stuff and helping us to communicate this stuff externally
[2019-01-22T17:53:41.689Z]	<kimhd>	ack heathervescent
[2019-01-22T17:54:21.669Z]	<rhiaro>	heathervescent: The comment about technology and going beyond, I definitely feel like it's an aspirational only from my direct experience with the group as a non-technical person. You're really good at all the technical stuff, so I think that if there's real desire to change that there has to be real change in the group
[2019-01-22T17:54:33.734Z]	<manu>	+1 to what heathervescent just said... I think it's a cultural thing...

[2019-01-22T17:55:27.157Z]	<rhiaro>	JoeAndrieu: What we noticed when the chairs talked last friday, it's fairly clear that getting the DID spec going is high priorty. There's a ton of stuff wallowing. Over 60 open issues and 9 open PRs
[2019-01-22T17:55:41.874Z]	<rhiaro>	... I want to go through those PRs in reverse chronological order and get a sense of whether we can close or merge these
[2019-01-22T17:56:08.007Z]	<rhiaro>	... Most of the conversation we want to direct to the PRs themselves on github. We don't need to dive into it, just identify if they're ready to go or need more work
[2019-01-22T17:56:26.547Z]	<rhiaro>	... 55: allow DID methods without update and delete. It does have some conflict so we can't merge it right off

[2019-01-22T17:57:43.692Z]	<rhiaro>	... Many have merge conflicts, and the conversations died down
[2019-01-22T17:57:53.107Z]	<rhiaro>	... There's another item which is Needs a new PR
[2019-01-22T17:58:02.158Z]	<rhiaro>	... it's good in concept, but needs a new PR to make it happen

[2019-01-22T17:58:16.238Z]	<rhiaro>	JoeAndrieu: Maybe we should just tag them?

[2019-01-22T18:01:23.231Z]	<rhiaro>	JoeAndrieu: One of the things that became apparent is that if we had resolved some of the PRs the issue wouldn't be there. So we look at the PRs, then return to the issue list
[2019-01-22T18:01:27.188Z]	<rhiaro>	mwherman2000: sounds good
