<div onmouseout="$('#link-9').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-9').show()" id="9" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  For the past 4 years, starting in WPCG, we&#8217;ve been talking about identity and exchanging claims (&#8220;attestations&#8221;) <a id="link-9" style="display:none;" href="#9">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; These concepts have been around for a while, and been in the &#8220;Identity Ecosystem&#8221; over the last 10-15 years. Mainly in IIW and other forums.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; Recently, it&#8217;s been called &#8220;self-soverign identity&#8221;. At the ID2020 event and rebooting web-of-trust workship, the concept of an architecture surfaced again.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; During this, dcrocker and others took a look at our work. We&#8217;re going to show the W3C members in a couple of months, so we&#8217;re trying to get it in good shape. It&#8217;s not done, but it&#8217;s a first cut.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; We need to quickly come to conensus.</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-10').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-10').show()" id="10" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Crocker</span>:  I want to stress my own view of archiecture diagrams is that they need to be simple and easy to understand. <a id="link-10" style="display:none;" href="#10">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; Ballancing this, they need to be complete enough.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; On average, diagrams are overly complicated. I was delighted with the diagrams from this work.</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-11').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-11').show()" id="11" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: This is the paper that we submitted to the ID2020 Design Workshop: <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/ID2020DesignWorkshop/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/a-self-sovereign-identity-architecture.pdf">https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/ID2020DesignWorkshop/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/a-self-sovereign-identity-architecture.pdf</a> <a id="link-11" style="display:none;" href="#11">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; In the NY discussion, we looked at ways to enhance it (not replace). We explored this over hours and Manu circulated some diagrams based on these talks.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; I realized that no where in the diagrams is there an indication of the identiy itself. Maybe there shouldn&#8217;t be, but we should think about that.</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-12').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-12').show()" id="12" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Here are the documents that we worked on at ID2020 - again *VERY PRELIMINARY / JUST FOR DISCUSSION* <a id="link-12" style="display:none;" href="#12">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-13').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-13').show()" id="13" class="comment"><span class="name">Drummond Reed</span>: I would argue that this is exactly what self-sovereign identity is about - there is NO BOX for a self-sovereign identity because there is no conventional &quot;identity provider&quot; <a id="link-13" style="display:none;" href="#13">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; I also find it useful to have diagrams which work at different levels. For example, public behavior vs private behavior. In email, there&#8217;s the user agent and mail transfer agent. Looking at RC 598, UA and MTA are still there, but there is also quite a bit more.</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-14').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-14').show()" id="14" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Version 1.0 (this is more or less the Credentials CG&apos;s architecture): <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebOfTrustInfo/ID2020DesignWorkshop/master/event-documents/graphic-recording/Day%202%2006%20Work%20Round%202%20Report%20Out/Day%202%2006%20WR2%20Self-Sovereign%20ID%20Arch%202%201o3.jpg">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebOfTrustInfo/ID2020DesignWorkshop/master/event-documents/graphic-recording/Day%202%2006%20Work%20Round%202%20Report%20Out/Day%202%2006%20WR2%20Self-Sovereign%20ID%20Arch%202%201o3.jpg</a> <a id="link-14" style="display:none;" href="#14">✪</a></div>

<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; The fact the original is still valid is still useful.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; For example, the repository is internal to the holder, so it might not need to be shown in the basic architecture.</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-17').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-17').show()" id="17" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  For those who don&#8217;t know, Dave is one of the people who created email standards. <a id="link-17" style="display:none;" href="#17">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-18').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-18').show()" id="18" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  I was intregued by was that in the original doc, we had DID in the center, and then it was moved over to be a number of different oracles. Can you explain? <a id="link-18" style="display:none;" href="#18">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-19').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-19').show()" id="19" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Crocker</span>:  I expect this to be controversial. A side point: the diagram has DiD and similarly the other box had &#8220;ledger&#8221;. One of the challenges is to distinguish between abstactions and implementations. &#8220;Ledger&#8221; has taken on the notion of an implementation approach. Similar with DiD. <a id="link-19" style="display:none;" href="#19">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-20').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-20').show()" id="20" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: We&apos;re looking at this diagram right now for those wondering: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebOfTrustInfo/ID2020DesignWorkshop/master/event-documents/graphic-recording/Day%202%2006%20Work%20Round%202%20Report%20Out/Day%202%2006%20WR2%20Self-Sovereign%20ID%20Arch%202%202o3.jpg">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebOfTrustInfo/ID2020DesignWorkshop/master/event-documents/graphic-recording/Day%202%2006%20Work%20Round%202%20Report%20Out/Day%202%2006%20WR2%20Self-Sovereign%20ID%20Arch%202%202o3.jpg</a> <a id="link-20" style="display:none;" href="#20">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; The other actors in the system need to query for information; there are different types of queries. The identiy itself, history of claims, other dynamic data. The ledger reference refers to a growing journal, but has data static when created. One might want to query dynamic data.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; The idea is to merge all of these into a single abstraction, which were listed in the box out of NY.</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-21').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-21').show()" id="21" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  The Oracle box includes ledgers, generators, registry and file stores. <a id="link-21" style="display:none;" href="#21">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-22').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-22').show()" id="22" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  I&#8217;m intregued by this change as it relates to smart signatures and can make use of a variety of different oracles. It&#8217;s an interesting new way to think about it. <a id="link-22" style="display:none;" href="#22">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-23').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-23').show()" id="23" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: +1 For this path <a id="link-23" style="display:none;" href="#23">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-24').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-24').show()" id="24" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Good news is that there&#8217;s not screaming to keep going down this path. In the coming weeks, we can refine these diagrams with the goal of fanalizing in the 3rd week of june. That&#8217;s when the WPIG would start reviewing, and see if we want to take to an IG meeting on July 1st. <a id="link-24" style="display:none;" href="#24">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-25').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-25').show()" id="25" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Crocker</span>:  I think that&#8217;s a realistic timeframe. Let me encourage to contact me directly offline. <a id="link-25" style="display:none;" href="#25">✪</a></div>
<h1 id="topic-3" class="topic">Topic: Decentralized Identifiers</h1>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-26').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-26').show()" id="26" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  In this group we&#8217;ve known that the decentralized identifier problem is very difficult to solve, but required for user-centric/self-soverign identiy. <a id="link-26" style="display:none;" href="#26">✪</a></div>

<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; The key think is the understanding that we need to have an identifier that can&#8217;t be taken away from an individual through force or coersion. We create the concept of a &#8220;WebDHT&#8221; (a hash table with history), but that&#8217;s getting into implementation details.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; A higher level requirement is that we have an identifier that can be instantiated and owned so that it can&#8217;t be taken away.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; We&#8217;ve discussed block chain, journal, DHT a number of times, but we should wind back and look at requirements.</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-28').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-28').show()" id="28" class="comment"><span class="name">Drummond Reed</span>:  It was a very intense discussion on DiD architecture. I have some notes freom that discussion. We got to concensus on goals of the architecture. We came down to two key goals: define the structure of an identifier that can serve as a discoverable key for a value. <a id="link-28" style="display:none;" href="#28">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; The value part is the &#8220;DiD object&#8221;: define the structure of an object that can provide cryptographic proof of DiD ownership and update permission.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; Also, for the DiD Object to provide pointers to other sources of claims and other peer DiDs. For purposes of privace protection, a person (or principal) may need to have multiple/many DiDs to keep different personas separate.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; From the standpoint of claims-based ID, the concept of a DiD-Tuple is a genesis claim, and is the starting point.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; most discussion was over a &#8220;public DiD&#8221;, so that you can refer to it to discover,lookup and verify a DiD. This corresponds to an &#8220;omni-directional identifier&#8221;. However, from a privacy consideration there are limitations. There are also cases for private DiDs shared by a limited set of holders, thus a &#8220;uni-directional identifier&quot;.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; There was discussion around DiD discovery. Could use ledgers or oracles as peers, which provides independence but not a known starting point.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; The second bucket was &#8220;addressable ledgers&#8221;, was to treat them as part of the URI space (ledger of ledgers). This would make the DiD itself addressable, but has questions of portability.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; The third option was meta-protocols to allow ledger interaction.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; The last option as the &#8220;index ledger&#8221;, the idea that by concensus there is a single DiD registry, where the object may be stored elsewhere, but there is a master index.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; We&#8217;re interviewing individuals intersted in this area and want to contribute; Anyone on this call is weclome to participate.</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-29').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-29').show()" id="29" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  We&#8217;re punting on naming, which has caused problems in the past. This should be reflected in the archiecture. Names are credentials not identifiers. People want the right to revoke credentials that are harmful, and this may have not been thought of enough. <a id="link-29" style="display:none;" href="#29">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; Secondly, on the meta-DiD discussion, we wanted to be able to move the root identier from one chain to another. Self-soverign users would have a choice of what chain to use, as well as the ability to move it later. We think we have some good answers by having every chain have it&#8217;s own DiD.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; These things are hard, but we think we can say it&#8217;s possible with this architecture, but don&#8217;t want to have to prove it first. The intent is to have a design which allows for portability, but this may be a 2.0 feature.</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-30').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-30').show()" id="30" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  The DiD stuff is a long-term need for verifiable claims work. Today, in the current architecture, we&#8217;re just using URLs. If you want to use it today, you must bind the claim to a URL, which places the domain holder in control. We&#8217;d like the DiD stuff to replace that. <a id="link-30" style="display:none;" href="#30">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-31').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-31').show()" id="31" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: Notes that, technically, it&apos;s still a URL if the scheme is &quot;did&quot; instead of &quot;https&quot;... this is still a URL: &quot;did:abcd1234...&quot; <a id="link-31" style="display:none;" href="#31">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; There is a system up already used in demos. The issue is that it&#8217;s just backed by a regular DB, it needs to be distributed.</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-32').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-32').show()" id="32" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: It&apos;s just dereferenced in some other way (TBD) <a id="link-32" style="display:none;" href="#32">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; We don&#8217;t need it to be ready by the time W3C membership votes, but we should have a plan.</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-33').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-33').show()" id="33" class="comment"><span class="name">Drummond Reed</span>:  One of the time-frames is based on the 6-month DHS contract. Our job there is to perform as many interviews as we can, trying to do 20-30 by the end of June and produce a sample architecture and prototype. <a id="link-33" style="display:none;" href="#33">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; We anticipate that a spec should/would come out of this. I&#8217;d like to get through the heart of the work this summer and be able to implement/test in the fall.</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-34').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-34').show()" id="34" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  Block Stack has implemented various aspects of this in their own architecture. We&#8217;re working with them to bring alignment; in effect, they offer DHT and could come into alignment with the overall DiD and self-soverign architecture. <a id="link-34" style="display:none;" href="#34">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; In oreder to do DiDs property you need a proof of existence, which was also worked on at the design workship, that will make the work easier to move forward.</div>

<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; Our first impressions was that we wished the human value was more prominent. It should discuss how system addresses real human problems.</div>

<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; For example, easily humanly recallable titles. I appriciate that there is confusion over this. Things like &#8220;the lazy doctor&#8221; in UC 4.3.1. We tried to come up with a short name capturing the human value of each use case. A lazy doctor doesn&#8217;t maintain credentials, but a bad university has credentials pulled.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; I&#8217;d like to give some examples of requirements modeling (not engineering).</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; I have some tools and techniques that can make these use cases easier to absorb, to capture essential interactions.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; One of the notes is that there is a lot to digest, and there was tension between a rigorous specification/detail, but this is at odds with the process.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; This puts the focus on a really good architectural diagram.</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-41').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-41').show()" id="41" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Speaking for myself, I think that would be fantastic. You&#8217;re group was forced to do it in an hour, which is really good. The W3C Membership may spend 5-10 minutes on it before moving on. The UC doc ends up driving requirements for a future WG. <a id="link-41" style="display:none;" href="#41">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">&#8230; People make two passes of UC, 5 minutes to vote to proceed, and the second set is people actually doing the work, who will look with a comb to determine if work is in scope.</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-42').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-42').show()" id="42" class="comment"><span class="name">Shane McCarron</span>:  You said you had trouble getting your mind on the difference between scenarios and use cases. Note that it was structured as requirements, with supporting use cases. <a id="link-42" style="display:none;" href="#42">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-43').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-43').show()" id="43" class="comment"><span class="name">Joe Andrieu</span>:  Use Cases are overloaded to mean a lot of different things. But sometimes UC is in the problem domain, or the solution domain. <a id="link-43" style="display:none;" href="#43">✪</a></div>
