[Tue 12:13:11] <dlongley>	drummond, no new name; the name will remain "The Credentials Community Group"
[Tue 12:09:59] <Lionel>	Topic: Introductions and Re-introductions
[Tue 12:10:29] <Lionel>	No one new for introductions, on to re-introductions.
[Tue 12:11:07] <Lionel>	lehn: Hi, I'm Dave Lehn from Digital Bazaar. I am involved in doing a number of implementations around Verifiable Claims, Linked Data Signatures, Web Payments, and the related cryptography suites. I've been involved in this work for over 7 years and will continue to support the group by doing implementations for the technologies incubated here.
[Tue 12:13:26] <manu>	Topic: Update on Community Group Name
[Tue 12:13:34] <Lionel>	ChristopherA: Regarding name change: after discussion, decided not to change the name.
[Tue 12:13:37] <drummond>	Okay, I just didn't know that the "new name" was.
[Tue 12:13:41] <voip-vctf>	Unknown [SIP/69.65.34.216-000002d4] has joined the conference.
[Tue 12:14:01] <Lionel>	manu: Fundamentally, this group started as the Credentials Community Group and only changed to Verifiable Claims after pressure from some larger organizations at W3C. In hindsight, it was a mistake to do this as "Verifiable Claims" has led to a number of confusing discussions related to what we're really doing here - which is creating credentialing technology. It was asserted by the "security community" that "credentials" were "usernames, passwords, and facebook logins" and didn't cover things like digital drivers licenses, educational certificates, and other concepts. Now that the group has more cryptographers, security advocates, and privacy advocates, it is clear that the group would prefer to keep the "credential" wording and thus we will have to circle back around to the organizations objecting to let them know that we've explored this topic in depth and have come to the conclusion that the group is really involved in the creation of credential technology.
[Tue 12:14:03] <squarfed>	voip: 2d4 is squarfed
[Tue 12:14:04] <voip-vctf>	Associated squarfed with SIP/69.65.34.216-000002d4.
[Tue 12:14:21] <drummond>	I'm good with "Credentials Community Group".
[Tue 12:14:54] <Lionel>	manu: Currently there are security, privacy experienced people in the group now so they can reflect the security-understanding of the word 'credential'
[Tue 12:15:22] <Lionel>	manu: This community advocates for claiming the word for its broad meaning outside of the limited 'credential = username/pass'
[Tue 12:15:44] <Lionel>	manu: This community holds the word to refer to credentials as commonly understood in the wider civic context.
[Tue 12:16:04] *	manu Lionel - make sure to put the person's name in front... so - manu: said so and so
[Tue 12:16:15] *	manu Lionel otherwise, we don't know who is speaking.... (in the minutes)
[Tue 12:16:52] <Lionel>	ChristopherA: the community could be easier to discover
[Tue 12:17:01] <Lionel>	manu: will take care of the redirects
[Tue 12:17:10] *	manu Lionel - perfect! thank you!
[Tue 12:17:19] <rgrant>	q+ moving or not, a simple top-level aggreagator page seems appropriate
[Tue 12:17:19] <voip-vctf>	rgrant has been added to the queue: rgrant
[Tue 12:17:44] <Lionel>	ChristopherA: the document availability challenge is made more difficult since the group has historically used many different docs in different locations

[Tue 12:23:42] <Lionel>	Kim: The W3C site poses some challenges regarding the control of the content, so I see it as a launching point for the credentials page
[Tue 12:23:55] <Lionel>	Kim: Let's see it as an entry point
[Tue 12:24:04] <Lionel>	Kim: Consider using the W3C wordpress blog

[Tue 12:30:33] <ChristopherA>	The purpose of the Credentials Community Group is to discuss, research, document, prototype, and test credential storage and exchange systems for the Iinternet, to allow for the standardized and interoperable creation of credentials and presentation of their proofs. It focuses on a credential as a verifiable assertion by an authority about a subject, entity, or person, and seeks solutions for both centralized authorities and self-sovereign

[Tue 12:46:54] <drummond>	We could say that "The outputs of the CCG could also support the development of interoperable reputation systems."

[Tue 12:47:36] <Lionel>	Moses: proposes defining reputation as a collection of credentials
[Tue 12:47:52] <rgrant>	q+ Should we play with reputation more in test implementations before putting it on the group agenda?
[Tue 12:47:52] <voip-vctf>	rgrant has been added to the queue: ChristopherA, JoeAndrieu, rgrant
[Tue 12:48:13] <Lionel>	Manu: Moses definition aligns with many discussions we have had. Given that, let's focus on the credential building blocks
[Tue 12:48:50] <rgrant>	q- Seems like I'm agreeing with Manu here
[Tue 12:48:50] <voip-vctf>	Seems isn't on the speaker queue.
[Tue 12:48:59] <rgrant>	q- rgrant Seems like I'm agreeing with Manu here
[Tue 12:48:59] <voip-vctf>	rgrant has been removed from the queue: ChristopherA, JoeAndrieu
[Tue 12:49:23] <Lionel>	Moses: ok, but let's make sure the building blocks collect the data needed to enable reputation.
[Tue 12:50:11] <Lionel>	ChristopherA: Let's defer that discussion
[Tue 12:50:12] <voip-vctf>	16179245273 [SIP/69.65.34.216-000002d8] has joined the conference.
[Tue 12:50:24] <rgrant>	+1 Internet
[Tue 12:50:26] <Lionel>	ChristopherA: Internet vs web?
[Tue 12:50:30] <JoeAndrieu>	+1 internet
[Tue 12:50:36] <Lionel>	+1 internet
[Tue 12:50:48] <rgrant>	JoeAndrieu: watch that capitalization ;P
[Tue 12:50:54] *	Lionel should we now debate capital I or lowercase?
[Tue 12:50:58] <Moses>	I'd be happy to lead a discussion in a month or so on low level functionality in VC that can support the development of robust interoperable reputation systems
[Tue 12:51:01] *	Lionel joe you beat me!
[Tue 12:51:08] *	manu suggests Interwebs  to please both camps :P
[Tue 12:51:30] <Lionel>	ChristopherA: decentralized registry v blockchains

[Tue 12:51:38] <voip-vctf>	rgrant has been added to the queue: ChristopherA, JoeAndrieu, rgrant
[Tue 12:51:38] <JoeAndrieu>	rgrant: correct. The Internet
[Tue 12:51:38] <Lionel>	ChristopherA: Thoughts?

[Tue 12:51:59] <drummond>	We don't use the term "blockchain" or "DLT" anywhere in the mission statement now.
[Tue 12:52:04] <JoeAndrieu>	not blockchains. +1 decentralized registries is inclusive without being restrictive
[Tue 12:52:06] <ChristopherA>	q?
[Tue 12:52:06] <voip-vctf>	The current speaker queue is: ChristopherA, JoeAndrieu, rgrant
[Tue 12:52:10] <ChristopherA>	ack ChristopherA
[Tue 12:52:10] <voip-vctf>	ChristopherA has the floor.
[Tue 12:52:10] <dlongley>	"blockchain" is unnecessarily specific, IMO
[Tue 12:52:12] <ChristopherA>	ack joe
[Tue 12:52:12] <voip-vctf>	joe isn't on the speaker queue.
[Tue 12:52:13] <rgrant>	q- rgrant +1 for DLT
[Tue 12:52:13] <voip-vctf>	rgrant has been removed from the queue: JoeAndrieu

[Tue 12:52:19] <voip-vctf>	Lionel has been added to the queue: JoeAndrieu, Lionel
[Tue 12:52:21] <kimhd>	agree on blockchain too specific
[Tue 12:52:36] <ChristopherA>	ack JoeAndrieu
[Tue 12:52:36] <voip-vctf>	JoeAndrieu has the floor.
[Tue 12:52:44] <webber>	I even think that DLT is too specific, since I'm not confident using a DHT really qualifies as a DLT
[Tue 12:52:45] <Lionel>	+1 blockchain too specific
[Tue 12:52:57] <ChristopherA>	q?
[Tue 12:52:57] <voip-vctf>	The current speaker queue is: Lionel
[Tue 12:53:03] <webber>	decentralized registries is good
[Tue 12:53:04] <ChristopherA>	ack Lionel
[Tue 12:53:04] <voip-vctf>	Lionel has the floor.
[Tue 12:53:17] <agropper>	I agree that reputation is much bigger than a set of credentials
[Tue 12:53:30] <manu>	Lionel: Decentralization and immutability are the key characteristics we want to go for... we don't want to be more specific and say "blockchain".
[Tue 12:53:34] <cwebber2>	+1 to registry
[Tue 12:53:47] *	Lionel manu thanks for scribing while i was blabbing
[Tue 12:53:56] *	manu happy to... :)
[Tue 12:53:56] <rgrant>	changing my +1 to registry.  seems sufficient for now.
[Tue 12:54:24] <Lionel>	ChristopherA: ...continues reading and discussing wording [see google doe for comments there] ...
[Tue 12:54:40] <webber>	btw, I'm convinced now that federation aligns with the decentralized social web usage
[Tue 12:54:47] <webber>	so a-ok with me
[Tue 12:55:12] *	cwebber2 on that note need to drop off to get to the decentralized social web meeting, take care
[Tue 12:55:44] <Lionel>	ChristopherA: let's privilege terms that are more amenable to search engine access
[Tue 12:57:11] <rgrant>	what does "incubate" add?
[Tue 12:57:13] <Moses>	To draw interest, we should mention more benefits?
[Tue 12:58:01] <kimhd>	I think experimental is redundant now
[Tue 12:58:53] <JoeAndrieu>	That was amazing collaborative editing. Much improved, folks.
[Tue 12:59:59] <kimhd>	I think we can close next week -- we seem close
[Tue 13:00:11] <drummond>	Yes, we can close next week
[Tue 13:00:18] *	agropper has quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[Tue 13:00:19] *	manu can stay a bit longer.
[Tue 13:00:20] <drummond>	I have to leave now, sorry
[Tue 13:00:27] <JoeAndrieu>	send not to list. we can close next week
[Tue 13:00:32] <JoeAndrieu>	note to list
[Tue 13:00:37] <manu>	yes, give us a week to marinate on it...
