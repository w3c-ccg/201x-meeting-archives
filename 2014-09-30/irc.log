[Tue 11:04:07] <m4nu>	Agenda: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2014Sep/0038.html
[Tue 11:04:26] <voip-cr>	Dave Lehn (SIP/6003-0000009d) has joined the conference.
[Tue 11:04:27] <dlongley>	scribe: mediaprophet
[Tue 11:04:37] <mediaprophet>	Manu: On the agenda today, making sure people know about the Web Payments use case vote, are registered for TPAC, and going through the use-cases. Any other additions/changes to Agenda?
[Tue 11:04:37] <mediaprophet>	No changes.
[Tue 11:04:53] <m4nu>	Topic: Web Payments Use Cases Vote
[Tue 11:05:19] <mediaprophet>	manu: web-payments use-group have finalised a draft that will be presented to the W3C Interest group at TPAC
[Tue 11:05:43] <m4nu>	https://web-payments.org/specs/ED/use-cases/2014-09-25/
[Tue 11:05:46] <mediaprophet>	Manu: basically the use-cases are more-or-less revised.  these cases came from paris. alot of identity use-cases moved into this group.
[Tue 11:06:08] <m4nu>	http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2014Sep/0155.html
[Tue 11:06:52] <mediaprophet>	manu: this is the use-cases, credentials is a big part of the use-cases. although it has been set in stone for web-payments, it’s very much the requirement for credentials group.  A vote is going on, if this is agreed upon. it will be the responsibility of this group to define the credentials solution
[Tue 11:08:05] <mediaprophet>	Manu: if anyone here is involved with web-payments, make sure you get involved with the vote. Basically, look at the use-cases and identify what the technical requirements will be for the web-payments work.
[Tue 11:08:35] <m4nu>	tim: Questions about the privacy stuff, what about the ODRL group? Is that fit to print? I need to follow up on that with you at some stage.
[Tue 11:08:40] <dlongley>	mediaprophet: We spoke about the privacy work and I'm not sure if it's going to fit the work, I'll follow up.
[Tue 11:09:16] <mediaprophet>	manu: i don’t know if we have the data rights stuff in there, I don't think we do have it in the Web Payments Use Cases doc.
[Tue 11:10:00] <mediaprophet>	manu: my concern is that we were talking about data rights in credentials, but not in web-payments. we need to do both
[Tue 11:10:18] <mediaprophet>	manu: because your purchase / transaction history can be used to track you.
[Tue 11:10:44] <mediaprophet>	manu: and ODRL we need to touch base with from both groups.
[Tue 11:11:17] <mediaprophet>	manu: the other thing to pay attention to, is that the payments process is exactly the same proces the credentials group will need to go through.
[Tue 11:11:32] <mediaprophet>	manu: my hope is that we’ll be able to go through exactly the same thing in the next few weeks
[Tue 11:11:36] <mediaprophet>	manu: any other questions?
[Tue 11:11:45] <m4nu>	Topic: Register Now for W3C TPAC
[Tue 11:11:54] <m4nu>	Web Payments IG now on the schedule
[Tue 11:12:08] <mediaprophet>	manu: important thing to note is that the web-payments session is in the schedule now.
[Tue 11:12:33] <m4nu>	https://manu.sporny.org/2014/3-wp-events/
[Tue 11:13:01] <mediaprophet>	manu: (W3C Web Payments Activity)  the web-payments interest group is listed. the vote to create the Web-Payments activity at W3C is going on now.
[Tue 11:13:33] <mediaprophet>	manu: if you are going to TPAC - make sure you register for the Web-payments group if you want to discuss the credentials work.
[Tue 11:13:44] <mediaprophet>	manu: talking about schedule….
[Tue 11:15:49] <mediaprophet>	Pat: is the meeting on wednesday?
[Tue 11:16:20] <mediaprophet>	manu: (discussing the way TPAC is organised this year). Basically, we can have the credentials meeting on Mon/Tue instead of Wed.
[Tue 11:16:42] <mediaprophet>	manu: the internet identity workshop is happening on the wednesday.
[Tue 11:16:55] <mediaprophet>	manu: perhaps we’ll announce an ad-hoc meeting on the wednesday.
[Tue 11:17:17] <m4nu>	tim: Still working on funding to get over there, if you could help w/ getting access to the W3C TPAC as an Invited Expert.
[Tue 11:17:17] <m4nu>	manu: Let's take the discussion offline, Web Payments group is being very strict about Invited Experts (which is unfortunate for the preliminary meeting).
[Tue 11:17:49] <m4nu>	Topic: Advanced Use Cases (Tim Holborn)
[Tue 11:17:56] <m4nu>	http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2014Sep/0019.html
[Tue 11:17:59] <mediaprophet>	manu: We went through the use-cases Tim Brought-up in the first email last week.
[Tue 11:18:25] <m4nu>	scribe: m4nu
[Tue 11:18:44] <m4nu>	tim: So, peer-to-peer advertising - concept was to wrap an Offer statement as a payment URL.
[Tue 11:19:05] <m4nu>	tim: Conceptually, make the offer discoverable.
[Tue 11:19:09] <mediaprophet>	http://webizen.org/
[Tue 11:19:40] <m4nu>	tim: That Webizen system searches FOAF URLs, so if you type in "tim" it'll pull information out from decentralized identities.
[Tue 11:20:14] <m4nu>	tim: This is about writing some sort of HTML-style document where you can specify an offer, and then potentially create a claim on that offer w/o needing to integrate it into a traditional content management system.
[Tue 11:20:22] <m4nu>	tim: Like an eBay or traditional merchant type website.
[Tue 11:20:43] <m4nu>	manu: This seems like a Web Payments use case.
[Tue 11:20:55] <Joerg>	should/ can commercial offers be represented by credentials, really? (Joerg Heuer, Deutche Telekom Labs)
[Tue 11:21:04] <m4nu>	tim: How do you make sure someone hasn't changed the payment URL? If they change that, then contract would be void.
[Tue 11:22:56] <dlongley>	https://web-payments.org/specs/source/web-commerce/#publishing-an-asset
[Tue 11:22:57] <m4nu>	tim: Would you generate a credential from that?
[Tue 11:23:07] <dlongley>	https://web-payments.org/specs/source/web-commerce/#publishing-a-offer
[Tue 11:23:21] <m4nu>	Joerg: If we go too deeply into the shopping experience that won't be good for this group. We'll have a session and something that offers a transaction in the Web Payments work, might not need to go deeper than that.. 
[Tue 11:24:19] <mediaprophet>	manu: this use-case touches credentials, but likely belongs in the web-payments group.
[Tue 11:24:56] <m4nu>	tim: When you're signing the document, does that protect it?
[Tue 11:25:12] <m4nu>	dlongley: Yes, if any of the information changes, the signature will fail. You can't tamper with it.
[Tue 11:25:41] <m4nu>	dlongley: A credential is a set of statements about an identity that is endorsed by some 3rd party. The most important part is that we're talking about a set of statements about an identity. We don't want to open the scope to be wider about that.
[Tue 11:25:50] <m4nu>	dlongley: That's not where we want to go.
[Tue 11:26:16] <m4nu>	tim: So the credential, we're dealing w/ the identity of a legal entity.
[Tue 11:26:46] <mediaprophet>	manu: only thing the digital signature does, is ensures the digital information that was signed cannot be tampered with.
[Tue 11:27:22] *	dlongley mediaprophet: https://web-payments.org/specs/source/web-commerce/#publishing-a-offer
[Tue 11:27:27] <mediaprophet>	manu: definition we use for credential is very specific, as defined in the charter...
[Tue 11:28:09] <m4nu>	dlongley: Take a look at Web Commerce spec, talks about publishing an offer. Describes what an offer would look like. The credentials work comes in where there is an ID for an entity (person providing offer, person receiving payment, etc.)
[Tue 11:28:30] <m4nu>	tim: I think where my confusion was was around the generation of the signature.
[Tue 11:29:43] <mediaprophet>	manu: this group is then going to work on the identity, such as drivers licenses, bank accounts and other identity information...
[Tue 11:30:17] <mediaprophet>	What consitutes a credential? The list from the call last week - http://opencreds.org/minutes/2014-09-23/#47
[Tue 11:31:03] <Joerg>	... but a credential coud be a 'proof of purchase' to let you access content, etc. Right?
[Tue 11:31:38] <mediaprophet>	tim: was it documented clearly?
[Tue 11:31:40] <dlongley>	Joerg, https://web-payments.org/specs/source/web-commerce/#the-receipt <-- proof of purchase
[Tue 11:32:00] <dlongley>	Joerg: still not a "credential", but is a digitally-signed document (a receipt) that proves a purchase occurred
[Tue 11:32:15] <dlongley>	Joerg: (that you can use to access content/service/whatever)
[Tue 11:33:04] <mediaprophet>	manu: is a proof of purchase a credential?  it is a digital receipt. you could say / argue it is a credential. we are arguing it is not a credential.
[Tue 11:33:09] <Joerg>	... using it as an access key - or to receive a special discount...
[Tue 11:33:47] <mediaprophet>	pat: it could be used if was used after the transaction?
[Tue 11:33:50] <m4nu>	Joerg: When talking about digital goods, you could use a digital receipt as a credential.
[Tue 11:34:20] <mediaprophet>	manu: a license to a particular person could be termed a credential.
[Tue 11:35:04] <mediaprophet>	manu: it depends on how the information could be used. but for right now, if you’ve got a bunch of statements about an entity. we’re saying that’s a credential.  if it’s something about an asset? we’re saying that’s not a credential.
[Tue 11:35:34] <m4nu>	dlongley: I think what's important is that we think of these definitions in how these systems can work together, we need to make sure to keep the scope limited.
[Tue 11:35:43] <Joerg>	Proposal - the subject of a purchase can be a credential - or a book or file...
[Tue 11:35:55] <m4nu>	dlongley: There's nothing wrong w/ those arguments, they could all be philosophically argued to be correct, we need to keep our scope limited to identity.
[Tue 11:36:11] <m4nu>	dlongley: Otherwise, all of this stuff will bleed together, and we won't be able to work on the technology.
[Tue 11:36:28] <m4nu>	Eric: I agree that definition is clear wrt. licenses.
[Tue 11:36:51] <m4nu>	Pat: Is the difference - anything that is a credential is expected to be used to authenticate?
[Tue 11:37:18] <Joerg>	We don't need to take care of every kind of credentials, I think.
[Tue 11:37:24] <m4nu>	dlongley: It might be that in one context something is considered a credential, in another context, it's not.
[Tue 11:37:49] <Joerg>	+1
[Tue 11:38:16] <m4nu>	Pat: Receipts are for verification that something happened, where authentication is for access... maybe more of a heuristic? What types of entities require a credential vs. a receipt?
[Tue 11:38:41] <m4nu>	Pat: Information about organization, government, individual, machine system doing the action - those require credentials for authentication purposes. Perhaps it's a heuristic.
[Tue 11:39:26] <mediaprophet>	manu: The key being we’re trying to narrowly scope the work, we do not need to take care of everything with a credential.
[Tue 11:40:24] <mediaprophet>	+1
[Tue 11:41:08] <m4nu>	Topic: Offer use case
[Tue 11:41:13] <m4nu>	http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2014Sep/0019.html
[Tue 11:41:24] <m4nu>	tim: I create a document to advertise the availability of my pushbike, including the amount i seek for the bike and the terms (pick-up only).
[Tue 11:42:00] <mediaprophet>	mediaprophet: selling a bike is similar to P2P Advertising.
[Tue 11:42:05] <m4nu>	tim: I create a document to advertise the sale of a T-Shirt.  I display the price (in local currency) and link to a shipping provider (to automate the shipping fees)
[Tue 11:42:00] <mediaprophet>	manu: This is a Web Payments use case - it's an offer of sale/availability/service. 
[Tue 11:42:07] <mediaprophet>	yup, Let's, move it to Web Payments CG.
[Tue 11:42:18] <m4nu>	Topic: Proof of Contribution Use Case
[Tue 11:42:30] <m4nu>	Tim: I use a credential when initiating PUT on a project, incorporating a multitude of others, and an agreement for contributing to project.  My credential is associated to my contributions for the purpose of remunerating me if the project moves to a point where a revenue is identified 
[Tue 11:42:30] <m4nu>	Tim:  Some of these Bitmark images show a variety of use-cases.  In the above example; the use-case denotes a ‘proof of stake’ rather than the use of a transactional credential of a fixed financial integer (meaning $1).  In the “contribute” example, a contributor may provide 1% of total contribution, or 10% of total contribution for stage 1, or 1% of total contribution to date, or 0.5% of total contribution - upon the date that the project is achieving critical mass (has a million users, is generating revenue, etc.)
[Tue 11:43:10] <mediaprophet>	contribute: so, the use-case is like using github
[Tue 11:43:49] <mediaprophet>	manu: the general idea is when you are working on a project, you want to associate your identity to your contributions. so if the project moves to the situation where it’s making money, you can be renumerated for it.
[Tue 11:44:26] <mediaprophet>	manu: you need to assocaite it to identity. which means we need some sort of URL that can be looked-up.  In the use-cases, it means you can find an identity URL. I think we already have this covered, we don't  need another use case. Does anyone disagree?
[Tue 11:44:28] <mediaprophet>	+1
[Tue 11:44:42] <mediaprophet>	+1 - all good..
[Tue 11:44:57] <SunnyLee>	nope
[Tue 11:44:59] <dlongley>	+1  - already covered by the use cases we have
[Tue 11:45:02] <m4nu>	Topic: Proof of Invention Use Case
[Tue 11:45:24] <m4nu>	tim: I write a document disclosing an invention i purport to have defined in a manner that would denote the work as being innovative.   I publish this specification, incorporating a credential that provides a date-stamp (“priority date” esk).  I submit an offer statement with respect to the use of the knowledge contained within that document; and perhaps define a specified market (i.e. use can MFG product for personal use or for commercial manufacture within these restrictions).
[Tue 11:46:33] <mediaprophet>	Essentially - a portion of the intellectual property process is establishing a priority date.
[Tue 11:46:56] <mediaprophet>	so, the objective is to provide sufficient information that supports this priority date requirement.
[Tue 11:47:43] <m4nu>	tim: There are several different parts - the first element is you make a claim of some point of innovation (identified a priority filing date). 
[Tue 11:48:39] <m4nu>	tim: Whether or not the patent should be granted is up to the national authority. So, the main thing - concept around publishing an idea on the Web, have it date-stamped, digitally signed, so that it's effectively the same as publishing via the USPTO.
[Tue 11:49:24] <m4nu>	dlongley: I'm trying to figure out what part of the standard would be used in this case. It involves digital signatures, assertion of certain identity writing a document, not seeing what would be standardized around this use case.
[Tue 11:49:37] <m4nu>	dlongley: Seems like it would be useful for someone to implement, why is it a credentials use case?
[Tue 11:50:51] <m4nu>	Joerg: This looks like something in EU framework - attribute-based credentials. I might have an institution asking me to ensure that they're not making me give away my identity/credentials. I think we should support attribute-based credentials, in scope - would like to see that. Overall process around it, assuring customer that everything is being done correctly, doesn't belong in credentials work.
[Tue 11:51:45] <m4nu>	Pat: Other interesting angle here is the inputs to the payment group - group working on verification on credentials - they should support for each transaction a composite signature - multiple identities being used to verify a particular claim. USPTO signature, plus mine, plus some other organization (counter-signatures) should be supported.
[Tue 11:52:40] <mediaprophet>	Use Case: Support endrosements/counter-signatures on credentials. Signatures can be either dependent on one another (chained together), or multiple signatures on original document (part of a mathematical Set).
[Tue 11:53:33] <dlongley>	scribe: dlongley
[Tue 11:53:33] <dlongley>	m4nu: We want to support both of these use cases: I give a document to Pat and Joerg and they both sign it and give it back -- or I give a document to Pat and he signs it and then gives it to Joerg who signs it (and includes Pat's signature).
[Tue 11:54:11] <dlongley>	mediaprophet: Is there a use case where the information can remain confidential before publishing?
[Tue 11:55:13] <dlongley>	m4nu: We have the technology to encrypt, so that's not a problem, so the questions is "Do we want to talk about encrypted credentials?" -- and the way most patent systems work is that you need to make a public statement when applying for a patent
[Tue 11:55:35] <dlongley>	mediaprophet: Don't you need to maintain confidentiality of the invention?
[Tue 11:55:52] <dlongley>	m4nu: Not for patents, in general, you have to make a full disclosure of a patent.
[Tue 11:56:13] <dlongley>	m4nu: For the confidentiality stuff we should be talking about private documents between people or organizations.
[Tue 11:56:24] <mediaprophet>	tim: in the preparation of a concept an ‘inventor’ wants to patent - does it need to be confidential prior to the publication of the ‘patent document’.
[Tue 11:56:31] <mediaprophet>	ie: drafts.
[Tue 11:56:42] <mediaprophet>	+1
[Tue 11:56:45] <m4nu>	dlongley: The disclosure of the patent is what gives you the power.
[Tue 11:56:49] <mediaprophet>	actually, I see what you mean now.
[Tue 11:57:41] <mediaprophet>	write a document on the web which supports an identity claim, a date stamp, digitally signed with the capacity to countersign the document
[Tue 11:59:04] <m4nu>	Pat: One of the other derivatives of the counter-signing thing is - what about composite credentials? Combinations of authorizations from multiple parties. You, completing transaction are authorized by multiple organizations. For example, USPTO - combining different elements of credentials from different organizations. In order to open bank account, I have to have different banking credentials  (drivers license, government credentials)
[Tue 11:59:13] <m4nu>	Pat: Using credentials issued by separate authorities.
[Tue 11:59:13] <m4nu>	Use Case: Enable multiple credentials from multiple 3rd parties to be composed together to grant authorization to access a system.
[Tue 11:59:55] <m4nu>	dlongley: We probably have a use case that you can provide credentials to authenticate. We want to make sure that we're clear that you can combine multiple credentials in a particular transaction.
[Tue 12:00:10] <m4nu>	Pat: How do I pass along organization's authorization along with my own credential information? We should answer that question.
[Tue 12:00:28] <mediaprophet>	Topic: Wrapping up Use Cases
[Tue 12:00:28] <mediaprophet>	manu: I think the plan is to try to get through the rest of the use cases next week and then see if we can put all of this in a document and vote on it to be ready in time for W3C TPAC. Anyone have any issues w/ trying to do that?
[Tue 12:00:28] <mediaprophet>	+1
[Tue 12:00:31] <dlongley>	+1
[Tue 12:01:47] <mediaprophet>	manu: Ok, then we'll do that - organise these into a more definative list of use-cases. and as long as everyone is ok with it, we’ll goto some sort of vote to get the first set of use-case agreed for TPAC. We'll try to do this next week.
[Tue 12:02:03] <mediaprophet>	+1
[Tue 12:02:10] <dlongley>	+1
[Tue 12:02:17] <SunnyLee>	thanks everyone
[Tue 12:02:17] <marybold>	thanks!
[Tue 12:02:17] <taaz>	bye all
