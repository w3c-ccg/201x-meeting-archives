<div onmouseout="$('#link-1').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-1').show()"" id="1" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Last week we talked about what happened at W3C TPAC. The good news is that the Web Payments IG wants to do something around Credentials; we&apos;re trying to figure out where to do the work and where to write the charter and tie up loose ends. <a id="link-1" style="display:none;" href="#1">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-2').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-2').show()"" id="2" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  There&apos;s an action item on me to propose a way forward for Credentials at W3C. We made a proposal; it had mixed feedback. We&apos;ll discuss that. We&apos;ll also be assigning tasks to folks. We&apos;ll give an update on our discussion with the SoLiD team as well. We chatted a bit with TimBL on the HTTP signatures stuff as well. <a id="link-2" style="display:none;" href="#2">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-3').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-3').show()"" id="3" class="comment"><span class="name">Henry Story</span>: Ah cool, interested about hearing the discussion on SoLiD <a id="link-3" style="display:none;" href="#3">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-4').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-4').show()"" id="4" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Anything else we need to cover today? <a id="link-4" style="display:none;" href="#4">✪</a></div>
<h1 id="topic-1" class="topic">Topic: Credentials Task Force in WPIG Update</h1>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-5').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-5').show()"" id="5" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="https://www.w3.org/Payments/IG/wiki/Main_Page/ProposalsQ42015/Credentials">https://www.w3.org/Payments/IG/wiki/Main_Page/ProposalsQ42015/Credentials</a> <a id="link-5" style="display:none;" href="#5">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-6').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-6').show()"" id="6" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We have made some modifications to the proposal as a result of the call yesterday. I&apos;ll review what was proposed and then talk next steps. <a id="link-6" style="display:none;" href="#6">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-7').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-7').show()"" id="7" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  The goal is to determine whether or not a W3C Working Group should be created. The outcome of this task force will either be a charter for the W3C member to vote on to start the work or it&apos;s going to be a finding that we should not do the work at W3C. Clearly, the people in this group would like to see it started at W3C. There are some other people who feel the world isn&apos;t ready to see this work start. <a id="link-7" style="display:none;" href="#7">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-8').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-8').show()"" id="8" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  A lot of the proposal is based on the survey we did. 58 orgs filled it out; how they view a proper credential ecosystem. We had them rate capabilities. We kept it data driven and so it was difficult for people who are against the work to argue against. <a id="link-8" style="display:none;" href="#8">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-9').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-9').show()"" id="9" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="https://www.w3.org/Payments/IG/wiki/Main_Page/ProposalsQ42015/Credentials#Concerns">https://www.w3.org/Payments/IG/wiki/Main_Page/ProposalsQ42015/Credentials#Concerns</a> <a id="link-9" style="display:none;" href="#9">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-10').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-10').show()"" id="10" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  There were a number of concerns that were raised. The concerns were added to the wiki. <a id="link-10" style="display:none;" href="#10">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-11').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-11').show()"" id="11" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Some of those concerns are questions we need to answer. Some of them we are in no position to answer. &quot;What is the jurisdictional scope of a credential and how are they regulated?&quot; Way too early to answer but it was raised as a question to answer at some point. <a id="link-11" style="display:none;" href="#11">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-12').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-12').show()"" id="12" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  In general, the IG said &quot;Yes, we should do something about this and this proposal isn&apos;t offbase.&quot; Only +1&apos;s to say we should proceed with the work. The pushback was where the work would happen. <a id="link-12" style="display:none;" href="#12">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-13').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-13').show()"" id="13" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  The proposal was that this group (this CG) would just shift gears and work on the questions. <a id="link-13" style="display:none;" href="#13">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-14').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-14').show()"" id="14" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  There was almost immediate objection to that. Because there are people (some of whom we know, and some of whom we don&apos;t know) that feel that we don&apos;t have a neutral forum here. Meaning, we&apos;ve worked on technology like the Open Badges stuff, technical implementations have been discussed and because of that, this group isn&apos;t neutral. <a id="link-14" style="display:none;" href="#14">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-15').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-15').show()"" id="15" class="comment"><span class="name">Henry Story</span>: Argh. <a id="link-15" style="display:none;" href="#15">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-16').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-16').show()"" id="16" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  A request was made for another group to be made that can&apos;t talk about the technology; and only talk about capabilities. <a id="link-16" style="display:none;" href="#16">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-17').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-17').show()"" id="17" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Speaking as an individual, this is fantastically frustrating because we strive to be very neutral in this group and have a good track record of doing so. This group started out with use cases and no particular technology focus. We had two input specs. We didn&apos;t have a strong technical view, etc. we did discussions, found data, worked from there. There are people are saying (again, people we don&apos;t know who they are) that we aren&apos;t neutral and that they weren&apos;t involved. These people didn&apos;t join the work a year or so ago but now they are saying that their views weren&apos;t taken into account. We have identified a number of people that we *do* know and we&apos;ve been talking with them and asking them to discuss things with us and that&apos;s great and is not an issue. The problem is the people who are only talking through W3C staff and we can&apos;t talk to them directly ... and the only solution seems to be creating a new group that is filled with the same people in this group, plus a few more, and that can&apos;t talk about technology solutions. <a id="link-17" style="display:none;" href="#17">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-18').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-18').show()"" id="18" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Please provide your input ... do you support a new Community Group focused only on capabilities and writing, no tech, etc. We need to hear opinions from this group. <a id="link-18" style="display:none;" href="#18">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-19').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-19').show()"" id="19" class="comment"><span class="name">Henry Story</span>:  If I look at the Linked Data Protocol group, which was headed by IBM. They had implementations, they had a lot of people, they had narrowed down the technology and the specifics and a proposal put forward. This seems suspicious to me; I don&apos;t know the process all that mutch, but it seems a bit weird. <a id="link-19" style="display:none;" href="#19">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-20').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-20').show()"" id="20" class="comment"><span class="name">Henry Story</span>:  I&apos;d like to speak with Arnaud and see what he said. I think you just need 20 members or some percentage to get people on board. The danger is if you get too many people on board then it&apos;s too general and becomes hard to succeed. That&apos;s me from an outsider&apos;s perspective. <a id="link-20" style="display:none;" href="#20">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-21').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-21').show()"" id="21" class="comment"><span class="name">Henry Story</span>:  You have more understanding, Manu, of the politics. <a id="link-21" style="display:none;" href="#21">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-22').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-22').show()"" id="22" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I think you&apos;re right in that it&apos;s strange. I think there&apos;s a fair degree of misunderstanding. There is a mismatch between what we&apos;re trying to do and what people think we&apos;re doing here. Let me try and draw where the various points of confusion are. I think there&apos;s a misunderstanding on what we&apos;re working on. Like we&apos;re working on authentication protocols like FIDO. We&apos;re absolutely not doing that here. The tech we&apos;re using here could be used with authentication but that&apos;s not what we&apos;re primarily pushing here. <a id="link-22" style="display:none;" href="#22">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-23').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-23').show()"" id="23" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  So there&apos;s confusion and objection over that. <a id="link-23" style="display:none;" href="#23">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-24').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-24').show()"" id="24" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  There&apos;s also confusion over where this group started. This group started with &quot;we need to have verifiable claims/attributes&quot; and we called them credentials and we were open to anyone to come and discuss at length. <a id="link-24" style="display:none;" href="#24">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-25').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-25').show()"" id="25" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I think one problem is that there is some work going on at IETF that is similar; that group had already started and was already charted and once chartered they really push their world view. For example JOSE. There&apos;s nothing wrong with that there&apos;s a good technical implementation that fits their use cases. But their use cases aren&apos;t our use cases. And some people looked at this work and thought &quot;nothing needs to be done.&quot; Now a year later, we have another group at W3C are backing doing work with Credentials. Now that other group is objecting because there would be two technical specs that conflict with one another. There are some things in common but I think the OpenID Connect, OAuth, IETF folks think there is more overlap than there is. For example, with the digital signature stuff, the JOSE folks are looking at that and saying &quot;The Open Credentials folks are coming up with a new signature format&quot; but they don&apos;t understand Linked Data; they aren&apos;t looking at the technology and they are just saying &quot;We should just try to use their stuff before doing something new&quot; without understanding that we already tried that. The mistake we made was not better documenting that effort. <a id="link-25" style="display:none;" href="#25">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-26').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-26').show()"" id="26" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  There are a couple of places where there is confusion: authentication vs. authorization, etc. and there are objections that our group is trying to do something that has been done before. There are people that don&apos;t understand the technology and some say we need to slow the process so people can understand that. <a id="link-26" style="display:none;" href="#26">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-27').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-27').show()"" id="27" class="comment"><span class="name">Henry Story</span>: Yep makes sense <a id="link-27" style="display:none;" href="#27">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-28').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-28').show()"" id="28" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I think those are the politics being played but I don&apos;t think any of it is mean spirited, I just think it&apos;s people who aren&apos;t familiar with the work we&apos;re trying to do and jumping to conclusions. And then those people talk to W3C staff and say &quot;You are on the brink of doing work that&apos;s being done elsewhere&quot; And W3C doesn&apos;t want to do that and says we need to document what&apos;s different. <a id="link-28" style="display:none;" href="#28">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-29').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-29').show()"" id="29" class="comment"><span class="name">Rebecca Simmons</span>:  What you said makes sense, but as an outsider it&apos;s hard to say what needs to be done. <a id="link-29" style="display:none;" href="#29">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-30').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-30').show()"" id="30" class="comment"><span class="name">Henry Story</span>: It would be itneresting to have a document to show how what you are doing goes beyond jose, for example. <a id="link-30" style="display:none;" href="#30">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-31').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-31').show()"" id="31" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  If we can answer all of the criticisms and make everyone happy then we can create a charter and go forward with the work. <a id="link-31" style="display:none;" href="#31">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-32').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-32').show()"" id="32" class="comment"><span class="name">Henry Story</span>: I have some ideas, of how it goes beyond, but it is interesting to know it. <a id="link-32" style="display:none;" href="#32">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-33').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-33').show()"" id="33" class="comment"><span class="name">Brian Sletten</span>: If we create a new CG, what&apos;s to stop them from throwing up obstacles to that CG? <a id="link-33" style="display:none;" href="#33">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-34').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-34').show()"" id="34" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  One primary question for this group: Do we want to push back and say &quot;This CG you are proposing is the same thing we&apos;ve already done. We&apos;d rather have the people who are objecting make themselves known and join us and have the discussion in public.&quot; the other choice is &quot;We&apos;ll create a new CG that doesn&apos;t talk technology at all and just talks capabilities and that group is going to go out and focus these people who are having issues and document their objections.&quot; <a id="link-34" style="display:none;" href="#34">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-35').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-35').show()"" id="35" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Or there might be another option? Thoughts from the group? <a id="link-35" style="display:none;" href="#35">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-36').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-36').show()"" id="36" class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  It seems clear that this is just a mechanism to push through their own agenda to overwhelm a new group. Even though technology discussions are off the table there I can see how it would be phrased to push one tech over another. It seems like a big scheme to me. I do think that the work we&apos;ve done over the last year is exactly what a new group would do. I&apos;d like to know what would be in front of a new CG that would be different that might then lead to a different outcome; otherwise it&apos;s a lot of wasted effort of a lot of people&apos;s time for no good reason other than to satisfy a powerful minority that seems frustrated. <a id="link-36" style="display:none;" href="#36">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-37').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-37').show()"" id="37" class="comment"><span class="name">Henry Story</span>: That makes sense to try to find out what these people want. <a id="link-37" style="display:none;" href="#37">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-38').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-38').show()"" id="38" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  To go back to Henry&apos;s point, you only need 20-25 member companies to say this work should start; but that is only after getting W3C Management approval. They have to agree there is consensus around what to work on. Right now ... I thought it was there, positive feedback from CEO and some staff contacts, but the person in charge of making the decision is unconvinced. We want to reach out to that person to find out what would convince them. I believe it&apos;s down to one person that is holding the process up. <a id="link-38" style="display:none;" href="#38">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-39').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-39').show()"" id="39" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I think the general point that the W3C staff members in the IG were making was that, &quot;yes, we realize that this is somewhat annoying, but you need to create a neutral playing field. If a group of people are saying there isn&apos;t a neutral field, you need to create one so they&apos;ll come in.&quot; One proposal is to create a new CG with the same calls and time as this one (just replace it) but tightly focus that group around the creation of a charter and answering the questions around what needs to be done. <a id="link-39" style="display:none;" href="#39">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-40').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-40').show()"" id="40" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  So there are maybe 8 people, at most, that we need to interview. We can say it has to be on the record and public on what needs to be done. Once we get all those interviews out of the way, we will clear those interviews with the W3C staff who are saying people are objecting; we&apos;ll get a list from them and interview those people, clearly document those concerns, etc. and then hope that the argument that those people feel they aren&apos;t being heard is addressed. <a id="link-40" style="display:none;" href="#40">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-41').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-41').show()"" id="41" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  The other approach is that we have way more than 20 orgs that want to start this work. <a id="link-41" style="display:none;" href="#41">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-42').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-42').show()"" id="42" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We could, instead, and say &quot;If you want something else done, you have to propose something. Everyone can&apos;t just stop because someone feels there&apos;s some nebulous better solution out there... if you feel it&apos;s out there, propose it so the group can talk about it.&quot; <a id="link-42" style="display:none;" href="#42">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-43').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-43').show()"" id="43" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  It would be an option to invite them to this group.

One of the problems with that is that we went out and documented a bunch of the stuff we&apos;ve been saying here in this group and doing an enormous amount of work which has moved things forward a bit, but not far enough. The onus is on us because we want to do something; all anyone else has to do is just object.
