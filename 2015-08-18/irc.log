[Tue 11:09:23] *	manu http://manu.sporny.org/2015/credentials-retrospective/
[Tue 11:10:37] <stonematt>	manu: will review and introduce the details of the expected/desired capabilities of the standard.  picking up where we left off last week
[Tue 11:12:30] <manu>	q+ to elaborate on why storing public keys in a decentralized network is important - you don't need a domain to participate, and everyone can participate
[Tue 11:12:31] <voip-cr>	manu has been added to the queue: manu
[Tue 11:12:51] <retsej>	q+
[Tue 11:12:51] <voip-cr>	retsej has been added to the queue: manu, retsej
[Tue 11:12:54] <manu>	ack manu
[Tue 11:12:55] <voip-cr>	manu has the floor (to elaborate on why storing public keys in a decentralized network is important - you don't need a domain to participate, and everyone can participate).
[Tue 11:12:57] <NateOtto>	q+ to ask about the consequences of compromised keys
[Tue 11:12:58] <voip-cr>	NateOtto has been added to the queue: retsej, NateOtto
[Tue 11:13:16] *	pindarhk (uid105966@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-nxxcwzmabndukgqj) has joined #credentials
[Tue 11:13:30] *	retsej manu is answering my question
[Tue 11:13:35] *	gkellogg_ (~gkellogg@156.39.191.244) has joined #credentials
[Tue 11:13:45] <retsej>	q-
[Tue 11:13:45] <voip-cr>	retsej has been removed from the queue: NateOtto
[Tue 11:13:51] <stonematt>	manu: web based PKI - allows individuals who don't own a domain (most people) to participate and have control of their own identity
[Tue 11:14:27] <stonematt>	q+
[Tue 11:14:27] <voip-cr>	stonematt has been added to the queue: NateOtto, stonematt
[Tue 11:15:13] <stonematt>	manu: far more accessible
[Tue 11:15:19] <pindarhk>	fwiw note https://letsencrypt.org/ for late this year
[Tue 11:15:19] <manu>	ack manu
[Tue 11:15:19] <voip-cr>	manu isn't on the speaker queue.
[Tue 11:15:36] <manu>	ack NateOtto
[Tue 11:15:36] <voip-cr>	NateOtto has the floor (to ask about the consequences of compromised keys).
[Tue 11:16:43] <stonematt>	nate: new/casual users may not follow best practices and their key could get compromised -what do they do?
[Tue 11:17:41] *	retsej 'consumers' are limited in thier ability to falsify credentials. So the 'user' would not be able to do anythign except sign keys verified by issuers
[Tue 11:18:00] *	retsej you cant make 'NEW' credentials
[Tue 11:18:19] *	retsej issuers being compromised is a real issue
[Tue 11:19:10] *	retsej the ultimate solution is a human being running your identiy provider who can revoke your key and authenticate an update
[Tue 11:19:15] <stonematt>	manu: key lists "owner" and others who have "key management" responsibility. you may be one of the "others" from another device and have a way manage your key.
[Tue 11:21:40] *	retsej a pre-genreated and backed up "revocation" certificate is also a common solution
[Tue 11:21:50] <NateOtto>	Does this date based invalidation require some kind of trusted timestamping mechanism on credentials?
[Tue 11:23:56] <retsej>	q+ so how does this system fail? what would be required to get the US to issue me a fake passport?
[Tue 11:23:56] <voip-cr>	retsej has been added to the queue: stonematt, retsej
[Tue 11:24:33] *	retsej manu keeps answering my questions right after I ask them
[Tue 11:24:34] <stonematt>	manu: financial industry uses dedicated hardware in offline datacenters for key management at the highest security level
[Tue 11:24:37] <retsej>	q-
[Tue 11:24:37] <voip-cr>	retsej has been removed from the queue: stonematt
[Tue 11:24:37] *	dlongley queue mission impossible music
[Tue 11:24:53] <pindarhk>	:)
[Tue 11:24:54] *	gkellogg_ has quit (Quit: gkellogg_)
[Tue 11:27:56] *	retsej Issue credentials authenticating the timesamp on a credential?
[Tue 11:28:22] <retsej>	q+
[Tue 11:28:22] <voip-cr>	retsej has been added to the queue: stonematt, retsej
[Tue 11:28:27] <NateOtto>	Yeah, I can certainly see trustworthy timestaming as a use case for the multiple signatures on a credential mechanism.
[Tue 11:30:15] <pindarhk>	 blockchain ?
[Tue 11:30:24] *	retsej Brendan
[Tue 11:30:38] *	retsej signature based blockchains would be really good for this
[Tue 11:30:44] <stonematt>	brendan: will have to do work to convince people to use PKI
[Tue 11:30:58] <retsej>	q-
[Tue 11:30:58] <voip-cr>	retsej has been removed from the queue: stonematt
[Tue 11:31:03] <manu>	ack stonematt 
[Tue 11:31:04] <voip-cr>	stonematt has the floor.
[Tue 11:31:06] <stonematt>	manu: will have to hide it.
[Tue 11:31:18] *	retsej Brendan and I are sitting at the same keyboard
[Tue 11:31:41] <manu>	stone: This gets to casual user managing their keys - if I have 3 devices with computers/tablets - key for each one - how much do I have to repeat that whole exercise of saying "I need 3 signatures to change anything"?
[Tue 11:32:04] *	retsej the idea is that you could do that iff you want
[Tue 11:32:22] <dlongley>	q+
[Tue 11:32:22] <voip-cr>	dlongley has been added to the queue: dlongley
[Tue 11:33:32] <stonematt>	manu: expressing assumption/expectation that people will use an identity provider
[Tue 11:34:02] <dlongley>	q-
[Tue 11:34:02] <voip-cr>	dlongley has been removed from the queue:
[Tue 11:34:37] <dlongley>	The system is flexible; you choose the level of security and convenience that works for you. Most people will delegate key management to their identity provider.
[Tue 11:35:27] *	retsej it seems that makign a new key of ephimeral certificates is moot. The consumer providing a challenge string seems sufficent
[Tue 11:35:30] <stonematt>	stone: do identity providers exist today?
[Tue 11:36:33] <stonematt>	manu: not today - no standard yet (that's what were here today) would advocate for existing ID providers like G+, Facebook etc would adopt
[Tue 11:36:49] *	retsej I cannot imagine things working ot such that we do not have an open source identify provider software
[Tue 11:38:34] <NateOtto>	manu: Individuals could self-sign claims about themselves, but nobody is going to trust that signature, because it's not authoritative. If the US Government issues a credential saying your name is James Dean, then people in the US would likely trust it.
[Tue 11:39:18] <stonematt>	manu: expect choice of identity providers, open source and commercial
[Tue 11:40:00] *	retsej PGP variable levels of trust? web of trust?
[Tue 11:40:35] *	retsej almost entirely brendan
[Tue 11:40:43] <stonematt>	manu: stakeholders can determine what types of providers to trust
[Tue 11:40:44] <manu>	q?
[Tue 11:40:45] <voip-cr>	The speaker queue is empty.
[Tue 11:40:59] <pindarhk>	Thanks... I need to drop off now, looking fwd to reading the minutes. tks all for an interesting call.
[Tue 11:43:08] <stonematt>	manu: App Integration - probably most open to interpretation.  user should be able to grant system access to your credentials
[Tue 11:43:38] <stonematt>	manu: .... for non-interactive manner
[Tue 11:43:57] <stonematt>	manu: need more focus to describe what this really means to us
[Tue 11:44:34] <stonematt>	manu: Privacy-enhanced Sharing:  share a credentiaal in a way that prevents identity provider to track you and your activities
[Tue 11:44:36] *	retsej donor status
[Tue 11:45:16] <dlongley>	q+
[Tue 11:45:16] <voip-cr>	dlongley has been added to the queue: dlongley
[Tue 11:45:28] <manu>	ack dlongley 
[Tue 11:45:28] <voip-cr>	dlongley has the floor.
[Tue 11:46:14] <stonematt>	dlongley: similar to SSO on the web like g+ or twitter, so the SSO provider knows where your logging it.  this concept of privacy isn't support in SSO today
[Tue 11:46:56] <retsej>	q+What is the intended mechanism for auditing privacy enhanced shares?
[Tue 11:46:57] <voip-cr>	retsej has been added to the queue: retsej
[Tue 11:47:12] <stonematt>	dlongley: a key desire it to prevent/block identity providers from knowing who the credential is shared with or who's verifying it
[Tue 11:47:31] <manu>	ack retsej 
[Tue 11:47:31] <voip-cr>	retsej has the floor (is the intended mechanism for auditing privacy enhanced shares?).
[Tue 11:47:40] <stonematt>	manu: unlike other capabilities, we're taking a philosophical stance here
[Tue 11:49:15] <stonematt>	manu: protocol would be setup so it's impossible for ID providers to know where a credential was shared
[Tue 11:50:34] <stonematt>	Brendan: need a way to unravel the privacy-enhanced sharing for things like law enforcement - we need another bullet point.
[Tue 11:51:37] <dlongley>	"regulatory compliance"?
[Tue 11:51:43] <stonematt>	brendan: need to include the concept of regulatory requirements for privacy in our capability
[Tue 11:51:55] <retsej>	+1 regulatory compliance
[Tue 11:52:05] <stonematt>	+1 regulatory compliance
[Tue 11:52:43] <stonematt>	manu: many of the credential and finance cases exist in industries/ecosystems that are heavily regulated
[Tue 11:53:15] <stonematt>	manu: Credential portability - should be able to move credentials between identity providers on demand
[Tue 11:54:19] <retsej>	+q Can we do anything more sophisticated than a credential TTL?
[Tue 11:54:42] <stonematt>	manu: credential revocation: support a way to revoke a credential if issued erroneously
[Tue 11:55:02] <manu>	q+ to specify how credentials are revoked.
[Tue 11:55:02] <voip-cr>	manu has been added to the queue: manu
[Tue 11:55:16] <stonematt>	q+ in capabilities how do we consider "updates" like an annual renewal?
[Tue 11:55:16] <voip-cr>	stonematt has been added to the queue: manu, stonematt
[Tue 11:56:14] <stonematt>	manu: all data is "linked data" with an id that lives on the web somewhere, which is verified in realtime.
[Tue 11:58:07] <retsej>	q+ How are we going to deal with requiring all this infrastructure required of issues which are historially very poor and maintaining/building such infrastructure?
[Tue 11:58:07] <voip-cr>	retsej has been added to the queue: manu, stonematt, retsej
[Tue 11:58:13] <manu>	ack manu
[Tue 11:58:14] <voip-cr>	manu has the floor (to specify how credentials are revoked.).
[Tue 11:58:18] <manu>	ack stonematt 
[Tue 11:58:18] <voip-cr>	stonematt has the floor (in capabilities how do we consider "updates" like an annual renewal?).
[Tue 11:58:45] <manu>	Stone: Revocation, in reality, happens much less than updating a credential - how do you have living data?
[Tue 11:58:53] <manu>	q+ to answer how credentials are updated.
[Tue 11:58:54] <voip-cr>	manu has been added to the queue: retsej, manu
[Tue 11:59:06] <NateOtto>	+1 stonematt Updating / renewing a credential happens far more often than revoking credentials in practice.
[Tue 12:00:04] <retsej>	q-
[Tue 12:00:05] <voip-cr>	retsej has been removed from the queue: manu
[Tue 12:00:19] <stonematt>	Brendan: how do we make it simple for issuers to manage this kind of technical capability when they're historically so bad at it?
[Tue 12:00:23] <voip-cr>	Nate Otto [SIP/sip2sip.info-00000022] has left the conference.
[Tue 12:00:30] *	retsej ??:Brendan
[Tue 12:01:55] <voip-cr>	Nate Otto [SIP/sip2sip.info-00000024] has joined the conference.
[Tue 12:02:00] <stonematt>	manu: there will be licensed technology provides.  expect the verification/validation app to be simple to host
[Tue 12:03:54] <stonematt>	manu: responding to stonematt... since this is "linked data" the credential could be fairly short lived and be linked back to the issuer for details OR may have a "refresh" link with update data
[Tue 12:05:11] <NateOtto>	In the news today about PKI: Here's a bunch of people's private SSH keys published publicly on GitHub: https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=filename%3Aid_rsa&type=Code&ref=searchresults
[Tue 12:05:12] <stonematt>	stone: this is a more sophisticated approach/solution than the simple verification url in the previous response.  Benefit - the system is very flexible in the way it can be deployed.
[Tue 12:05:33] <retsej>	no questions. Thanks!
[Tue 12:05:52] <retsej>	We managed to sneak a lot of those in.
[Tue 12:05:52] <manu>	Present+ taaz, laura
