21:13:59	 From jonnycrunch : q+
21:14:22	 From Drummond Reed : What?? No ABNF discussions? Rats :-)
21:15:15	 From Dmitri Zagidulin : hahaha when we can snatch a pebble out of Markus’s hand, THEN we’ll be ready for ABNF
21:15:37	 From Drummond Reed : Yeah, but he’s in Vienna. Long ways for that pebble :-)
21:15:44	 From Dmitri Zagidulin : distributed systems are hard :)
21:19:47	 From jonnycrunch : q+
21:19:50	 From Kim Hamilton Duffy : That seemed to be consensus from the last CCG call; no objections here
21:22:17	 From Kim Hamilton Duffy : q+ -1 to DID URL. for the full thing, could it be something less overloaded, like DID Resource Locator?
21:22:37	 From Mrinal Wadhwa : But a DID is also a DID URL?
21:22:50	 From Drummond Reed : Yes, a DID is a DID URL.
21:23:24	 From Mrinal Wadhwa : Got it, thanks Drummond
21:23:31	 From Kim Hamilton Duffy : I feel like DID URL is the natural selection if you’ve taken the time to wade through the discussions we’ve had (and understand URLs/URIs, …)
21:23:35	 From Drummond Reed : The point about the terms is that “DID” by itself only means the colon delimited portion. “DID URL” means the colon delimited portion PLUS anything else that’s valid.
21:23:53	 From Kim Hamilton Duffy : We’re going to end up explaining it to non-initiated folks again and again
21:27:54	 From Oliver Terbu : URL also has Resource Locator in it ;)
21:28:20	 From Kim Hamilton Duffy : +1 for that
21:29:30	 From Kim Hamilton Duffy : Yeah, to be clear my suggestion was a straw man to avoid overloaded terms. But we should drill into that outside of this call. It may make more sense to
21:29:53	 From Mrinal Wadhwa : Dereference would also come with resolution metadata?
21:29:58	 From Kim Hamilton Duffy : It may make more sense to distinguish the “DID” part. But again, there’s risk of sounding redundant.
21:31:48	 From Kim Hamilton Duffy : Definitely +1 to reuse 3986 patterns
21:32:05	 From Drummond Reed : For those who care about this level of detail, there is actually a distinction between a “DID Reference” and a “DID URL”. A DID URL is always absolute, whereas a DID Reference may be either absolute (a DID URL) or a relative reference (the part that follows the DID).
21:32:33	 From Dmitri Zagidulin : q+
21:33:17	 From Dmitri Zagidulin : -1 to that. the concept of “did resolution” is general enough, and useful enough, to have it
21:34:40	 From Dmitri Zagidulin : that part is going to be addressed in a later slide
21:35:40	 From Kim Hamilton Duffy : I’d like to look at the proposal and see if that “resolves” this
21:37:11	 From Kim Hamilton Duffy : Would like to see later slide Dmitri mentioned and come back to this
21:41:12	 From jonnycrunch : q+
21:44:11	 From Kim Hamilton Duffy : q+ clarifying question
21:46:21	 From Kim Hamilton Duffy : Ok, so this is saying dereferencing syntax is method-independent; methods are not required to implement. This will work for BTCR
21:46:50	 From Dmitri Zagidulin : I would even add - it’s not that methods aren’t required to implement it. It’s more like, it’s completely unrelated to methods
21:47:13	 From Kim Hamilton Duffy : hmm…mulling that over
21:47:32	 From Dmitri Zagidulin : so your ledgers or methods, will /never/ see the reference part of that url
21:47:35	 From Kim Hamilton Duffy : Ok, I think I see what you’re saying
21:48:13	 From Michael Herman  To  Markus Sabadello(privately) : Can you post a link to the prez? ...I would like to see what is coming to better understand whether I should comment further on this slide.  Thx
21:48:14	 From Kim Hamilton Duffy : right, ok! That’s a better way to think about it
21:48:34	 From Markus Sabadello : will post the slides after the call
21:49:23	 From Michael Herman  To  Markus Sabadello(privately) : q+
21:49:36	 From Michael Herman : q+
21:53:15	 From Michael Herman : q+
21:56:00	 From Drummond Reed : Swagger?
21:57:19	 From Drummond Reed : FYI, I have a very hard stop at the top of the hour, so I’ll have to drop promptly at that point.
21:57:28	 From Mrinal Wadhwa : HEAD?
21:59:37	 From Drummond Reed : Great discussion so far, and big thanks to Markus and Dmitri for driving this.
21:59:45	 From Kim Hamilton Duffy : Tangent: looping back to the early slide on DID/DID URL terms. I think now I agree these are good terms. Maybe it’s just repetition :) but it’s starting to seem increasingly natural. We will end up defining these up front for specs/discussion anyway, and the alternatives I can think of do not improve that state…and in fact make the terms longer/more confusing.
22:00:01	 From Drummond Reed : +1 Kim
22:00:06	 From Drummond Reed : Bye now
22:00:27	 From Mrinal Wadhwa : Thank you all, this was great
