<div onmouseout="$('#link-64').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-64').show()" id="64" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  These things tend to go in 3 stages <a id="link-64" style="display:none;" href="#64">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... The first is the ideation process. This is what we depend on the IIW, RWOT, DWeb summit, conferences that happen, new ideas thrown out there, get momentum, until they get to a point people want to work on it</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... Eg. for VC stuff ideation happened between the RWOT was one of the first places, moved to IIW and between RWOT and IIW the idea was kicked back and forth until it got to the point that there was a spec and it moved through the rest of the process. Same with DIDs.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... The first stage is ideation, doesn&apos;t happen here typically, this place is the second step in the process, which is incubation</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... You come up with an diea that&apos;s stage 1. Stage 2 is incubate the idea. People start writing waht the first spec might be, putting pen to paper and talking about the thing and refining it</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... That&apos;s more or less what this group does</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... What we&apos;re trying to do is take these ideas, get someone to write about them, then get devs to implement them. Refine it, play around, incubate it. That&apos;s what the CG is about. At a certain point in time it hits the stage where it&apos;s ready for global standardization</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... We decide where to put that work. Might go to the IETF if it&apos;s a low level protocal. OASIS if it&apos;s to do with business processes. Might go to the W3C if it has to do with the web or application layer stuff. Fundamentally we find the place where it should be globally standardized and send it off to the third stage</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... The third stage is standardization at a standards setting body. These are special organisations, from a legal perspective they cover what it means. The timeline for those things...</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-65').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-65').show()" id="65" class="information">The three stages, ideation, incubation, standardization.

<div class="comment-continuation">... The incubation stage takes about 1-2 years, and standardization takes 2 years</div>

<div class="comment-continuation">... There are a lot of things where we can create an API or a recommendation that does not have the standing of an international standard and it can end here. We don&apos;t have to go through the entire process end to end</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... Part of what I&apos;m tryign to filter is what are the things that really deserve standardization. These are the things epople can use APIs, propocols, data formats etc, as a way to lock in to a single model, a single approach that doesn&apos;t allow for competition and collaboration</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... Taking my hat off I know some of my pain points are how do we ???</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... how do you request a verifiable credential, a verifable presentation. How do you do so in a data minimizing protocol way. I do&apos;nt want a static give me yoru VC, I want a negotiation between two parties so they can determine the max the client is going to give and the minimum the rquester is going to get.

<div class="comment-continuation">... Another is that we still don&apos;t have cryptographically reviewed signature proofs and things of that nature</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... We need to be thinking not only about zero knowlege ways and blinding, but data minimization. Do we recommend to issuers they issue every single attirbute individually by itself so a person has a package of 100 claims with 100 attributes, or do we come up with some other scheme wehre they don&apos;t have to give proofs for all of those entries</div>
