<div onmouseout="$('#link-5').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-5').show()"" id="5" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  I&apos;ve been involved with online communities since the early 80&apos;s. I was one CompuServe, head of the computer international consulting association ... consulting board on there, I had hosted a number of BBSes, I published the first BBS for the Mac and the first Mac interface for a online community. <a id="link-5" style="display:none;" href="#5">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-6').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-6').show()"" id="6" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  I was also involved with early pre-internet methodology for transmitting information including [missed] which is like news today but it&apos;s a p2p protocol. So we can talk about how we did that back in the 80s, it&apos;s not new. In the late 80s I was involved in [missed] involving the technological consensus with database architectures and such and the human problem and the core of what I wanted to work on for the next 25 years. I came out with my first product and people didn&apos;t trust it so I entered into crypto. I was involved groundfloor with RSA and its algorithm and involved in its privacy efforts and [variety of crypto tools] in the early 90s. That ultimately set the stage for writing the reference implementation for SSL and then later leading the standards effort for TLS 1.0 at the IETF. <a id="link-6" style="display:none;" href="#6">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-7').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-7').show()"" id="7" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  I was the editor along with Tim Dierks for the standard and ran the online communities, mailing list, for all practical purposes I was the defacto director of that working group and we published version 1.0 of the standard in &apos;97 and today it&apos;s the most widely deployed security standard, [stats on business]. Early architecture decisions we made proved to be solid like perfect forward secrecy which was something that was in the spec early on, it&apos;s only been implemented in the last couple years. Not only used to secure the Web it&apos;s used to secure other standards ... the ports I registered for doing SSL email later TLS with email, Google reported last year 60% of all outgoing email was secured by TLS and 50% incoming. Which is in great excess of anything secured by SMIME or SFTP anything. <a id="link-7" style="display:none;" href="#7">✪</a></div>

In the crypto field I did some work at Certicom and did smart signatures and smart contracts but it was too early, in the last few years I&apos;ve been bringing those skills back to secure android platform and most recently I&apos;ve been doing stuff in the blockchain with secure engines of trust in the last yera, including teaching in university and doing consulting for big and small. I&apos;ve been working on OASIS standards to help XDI move to blockchain. <a id="link-8" style="display:none;" href="#8">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-13').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-13').show()"" id="13" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  What we&apos;re trying to do is ... the main gist of the way we&apos;re stating the problem here is that we&apos;re talking about user-centric design. We&apos;re asserting there is no widely user-centric standard for expressing verifiable claims, via the Web and there&apos;s a desire to create such an ecosystem. We&apos;ve tried to define was user-centric means through talking about what some of the design ramifications are. For example ... <a id="link-13" style="display:none;" href="#13">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-14').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-14').show()"" id="14" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  A service-centric system would be like facebook, twitter, etc. <a id="link-14" style="display:none;" href="#14">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-15').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-15').show()"" id="15" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  Right, I&apos;m very familiar with this movement, as far as calling it user-centric was really pushed in the late 90s early 00s, augmenting the social network, the early thing ... I&apos;ve been part of the IIW community pretty much from the beginning. The core of the ... problem, my alignment is with it being about user-centric. It&apos;s been co-opted a little bit, but I&apos;ve been moving increasing into &quot;self-sovereign&quot; as the key-phrase for this. Which is a little distinct from user-centric. But clearly the same territory. I think ti&apos;s important for a variety of reason. There&apos;s an innate power imbalance in our society where individual power severely hampered by the financial power and the legal authority of other parties. Going back to the US constitution, how do you enable the individual to balance that power around authorities. <a id="link-15" style="display:none;" href="#15">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-16').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-16').show()"" id="16" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  The natural power of aggregation of financial authority, etc. we need forms of everything from the class action lawsuit, etc. to overcome these kinds of natural aggregation and network effects that happen in system.s <a id="link-16" style="display:none;" href="#16">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-17').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-17').show()"" id="17" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  We have to balance those natural powers with powers that are for the user. That&apos;s where the self-sovereign is a bit stronger and why I value that myself. Clearly, the world in the last few years has been going ... <a id="link-17" style="display:none;" href="#17">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-18').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-18').show()"" id="18" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  We moved to centralized structures and we had problems there and then out to decentralized and we had problems there and then back to centralized and we&apos;re in the middle of a centralized surge. Facebook, etc. Governmental powers wanting to do things. I&apos;m not a libertarian, I don&apos;t consider myself a cryptoanarchist or anything, but I do believe in balance. <a id="link-18" style="display:none;" href="#18">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-19').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-19').show()"" id="19" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  That clearly is part of my motivation with being involved in these decentralized techs that are finally possible today. They haven&apos;t won. Banks, etc. are looking at this as something they need to investigate. At this point there is no proven example there. <a id="link-19" style="display:none;" href="#19">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-20').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-20').show()"" id="20" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  Walking through this, user-centric is the first thing that I do, I am also very ... I think the space of verifiable claims and attestations is a very important sweet spot. Interop is very powerful. We&apos;ve talked about service-centric architectures mean that people who lose their facebook relationship for whatever reason lose years of identity and reputation and history with their peers. <a id="link-20" style="display:none;" href="#20">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-21').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-21').show()"" id="21" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  If you go by the individual definition of social network individuals own their own social network, it shouldn&apos;t be owned by a service. Lock in and fragility or the opposite of it like resilience is important. Standards that cut across industries, clearly, we have a lot of issues in the area... I&apos;m a big fan of privacy I write a lot about it but if you look at a lot of things and how they are legislated like HIPAA, they enforce a man in the middle. Which is the antithesis of what cryptographers want to avoid but it&apos;s mandated by the legislation. That has to do with the centrality of things again. <a id="link-21" style="display:none;" href="#21">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-22').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-22').show()"" id="22" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  Maybe they&apos;ll come up a little later in this discussion, but I also want to look at things from a crypto perspective and in order to prevent things like correlation, to allow for certain kinds of privacy things mandated in the EU or .... you can&apos;t do some of these without designing from a self-sovereign perspective from the bottom. It *has* to be done that way from a crypto perspective, I can&apos;t see how you can do it the other way. You can have wonderful policies about how all of this can work what can be shared and you can enforce them by policy and then have things like &quot;more Jews died in Holland in WWII as a percentage of population vs. Germany&quot; because policy respected them but then things changed. So just because policy works today doesn&apos;t mean it won&apos;t fail in the future. Building things on human rights privacy is good but policy is based on economic rights sometimes. The European style rights privacy can&apos;t be solved by a service centric perspective, at least I don&apos;t know how to do it, it can only be solved from a user-centric perspective. 30+ years working in this community. <a id="link-22" style="display:none;" href="#22">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-23').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-23').show()"" id="23" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Do you think we&apos;re in the right ballpark then ... with our assertions about user-centric systems. If we were to do one thing that would be creating this self-sovereign approach for verifiable claims would that be a worthwhile endeavor? <a id="link-23" style="display:none;" href="#23">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-24').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-24').show()"" id="24" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  Yes. The only thing missing seems to be policy and maybe more crypto. <a id="link-24" style="display:none;" href="#24">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-25').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-25').show()"" id="25" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  In way way do you feel it&apos;s missing? We point out this needs to involve crypto, it&apos;s not a policy based solution we&apos;re searching for it&apos;s a crypto-based solution? <a id="link-25" style="display:none;" href="#25">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-26').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-26').show()"" id="26" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  Yeah, and I dont&apos; see that in the problem statement. <a id="link-26" style="display:none;" href="#26">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-27').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-27').show()"" id="27" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  Nothing talks about that enough. <a id="link-27" style="display:none;" href="#27">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-28').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-28').show()"" id="28" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Ok, I think that&apos;s just fundamental assumption we&apos;re making but we should point out that that&apos;s how we intend to address some of that in the problem statement. We were asked not to propose solutions but to just identify the problem -- and let the solutions come out in the actual work later. <a id="link-28" style="display:none;" href="#28">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-29').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-29').show()"" id="29" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  You&apos;re not mentioning it at all and you will have to be diving into it. Even if you don&apos;t talk about it ... maybe they are more principles, a couple of principles are necessary to say, we&apos;ve already talked about self-sovereign, but maybe add to that something along the lines of minimum-disclosure required to interact. Which might include methods like [missed]. We don&apos;t know .. it&apos;s a hard problem space, we want to encourage minimum exposure but we want to enable business interactions and cooperation. So what is the minimum necessary to do so and not go beyond it. Today it&apos;s all or none. <a id="link-29" style="display:none;" href="#29">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-31').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-31').show()"" id="31" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  Maybe as a &quot;principles&quot; type of thing. <a id="link-31" style="display:none;" href="#31">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-32').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-32').show()"" id="32" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Any other concerns over the problem statmeent? <a id="link-32" style="display:none;" href="#32">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-39').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-39').show()"" id="39" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  Yes, there are things in user-centric design that make it harder for large orgs to do certain things but they have more money and power, and I consider that an acceptable balance. <a id="link-39" style="display:none;" href="#39">✪</a></div>

If you look at PGP, trusting is often over-interpreted, but fundamentally, do I believe that the party at the other end has properly generated a public+private keypair. That&apos;s all it really means. The problem is ... that&apos;s not what it really says and it&apos;s not precise enough. If the recipe could be what it really is instead of a broader interpretation of what it actually means that would be much better. All of these things that got interpreted into what a PGP credential meant ... that&apos;s when it breaks. Having some good recipes that are very precise as to their nomenclature and the rules for that ... that can be done and can scale. Allowing anyone to make a weird, reputation claim in a not-well reputation claim in a weird area that&apos;s madness and there&apos;s no way to scale that. <a id="link-50" style="display:none;" href="#50">✪</a></div>

I wrote a lot about ratings systems in my blog and on collective choice... including in one of our own ratings systems we got demonstrably better ratings [missed]. If you look at that tech there&apos;s a big difference between a rating and a ranking. Issuers are in the same space as rating and ranking requires a lot more and that&apos;s where your curators are. They have a very different role in saying &quot;someone&apos;s credit rating is greater than that of someone else&apos;s&quot; as opposed to &quot;this person has great credit with VISA, their card has already been paid on top.&quot; That&apos;s a different thing from a curation of a lot of different ratings together.

If you look at this from &quot;who benefits from it&quot;, the curators and consumers are benefitting the most I think.

On the objective issue side of things, I think that in order provide for non-correlatable identifiers and things of that nature you&apos;re going to have to use more complex crypto than what is RSA-based single-key based CA-based architectures are of the JOSE stack. And, they have a relatively constrained format that makes some of those things hard. Obviously, every standard can adapt. That&apos;s where we get to the subjective. I just find the JOSE stack to be cumbersome and not ... I just hate the fact that in order to both encrypt and sign something you have to actually put the base64 of the encrypted thing in with it because the JSON isn&apos;t consistent in how it&apos;s represented.

This was an issue with TLS way back when. Everybody had a different algorithm and hash and MAC mechanism, etc. They all wanted them to be able to slide in and in different ways and combos. But auditing that from a security point of view was *incredibly* hard. And that&apos;s kind of how I feel about JOSE. On one hand they have some weird constraints but on the other areas where I *want* to be constrained, they are wild.

What will be most easily adapted to the kinds of changes necessary. Limiting crypto suites ... is a desirable approach, not only doing crypto on the server, ... there&apos;s no reason why in TLS you don&apos;t theoretically have the server send a credential at all, .... you can get just the same kind of MiTM prevention by having a client send something. It&apos;s just that in the 90s the servers were more powerful than the client, so you tried to do all the crypto on the server. That&apos;s not true anymore. My iphone has a cryptographic co-processor inside it with a hardened area inside of it. Even IoT ... we&apos;re recognizing that you need to have crypto at the leaves.

That&apos;s very important, I happen to be really biased towards hierarchical trees of keys because they allows a user to have a key completely offline that can&apos;t be stolen yet allows them to create other keys and delegate and let them do other things. I can let my phone do a bunch of things on my behalf, but if it&apos;s stolen I can create a new subkey very easily. I feel like that it&apos;s a fundamental thing to design that from the beginning to support that type of functionality. There are other benefits you get, for instance, I can give the company I&apos;m renting my apartment from an identifier -- and the company I&apos;m getting the power from ... and give them each a different identifier and maybe they can&apos;t correlate (maybe a bad example because they both have my physical address). My email provider doesn&apos;t need to know those things ... if those two companies share information those two identifiers wouldn&apos;t let them correlate and say &quot;oh, this is the same party.&quot; That&apos;s a good thing for hierarchical keys. One of things with ratings systems in general ... a rating is only is good as the point at which it was issued, so time is very important.

Writing a good rating/ranking system, various other kinds of systems are hard and we need some good use cases and recipes and really understand the problem and one of the first use cases is badges. Maybe simply that you&apos;ve completed something. Something that is less than a degree but more than ... you&apos;ve opened a webpage.

I can prove to you that that&apos;s problematic. 5 star ratings are a bad design, we do them repeated because people have seen them in the past and they are used to them, but they have a number of serious flaws. First off, a lot of people think 3 is the middle. Well, 2.5 is the middle. There is no 2.5 stars. Due to the nature of how you ask the question people are more likely to rate things positively or negatively. An amazon book rating of 4 stars is the low average. That means that your fellow buyers ... less than 50 percentile is a 4 star book. That&apos;s not obvious. People see that as &quot;oh that must be a good book.&quot; 4.1 or 4.2 is an average rating for an amazon book.
