[Tue 11:17:40] <les>	Drummond: it was remarkable how verifiable claims have become a number one topic during RWOT
[Tue 11:18:28] <les>	Manu: we still have a bit of work to do to raise the questions over the work to the w3c mgmt
[Tue 11:18:41] <Drummond>	Yes, I agree with Manu that the assumptions of the RWOT attendees that verifiable claims were "just there" was a little dangerous
[Tue 11:18:49] <manu>	Topic: Internet Identity Workshop #23
[Tue 11:19:02] <manu>	We did two sessions there - the first - Intro to Verifiable Claims: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pY6TGsCBzmui_KVM5Q71t1LbHgdv10vRPov7SoISjqU/edit

[Tue 11:21:55] <les>	Manu: The link above shows the people that attended ... good number
[Tue 11:22:44] <les>	Manu: IIW team invited VCTF to come back ... they felt it was great for the communities to come together ... good synergies
[Tue 11:24:00] <les>	Drummond: DID and IIW - took WD04 into a another intensive session. Focus on how to provide internet scale identity. went deep into DDOs
[Tue 11:24:19] *	manu hey phila - once we get through the next agenda item, i'd like you to introduce yourself to the group... would that be okay?
[Tue 11:24:34] *	phila sure manu 
[Tue 11:24:41] <les>	Drummond: DID's work independently sponsored by DHS ... not yet part of a standards group. Goal to get the spec done this month
[Tue 11:25:11] <les>	Drummond: 1 for sovrin, 1 for bitcoin and a couple of etherium methods to be specied
[Tue 11:31:28] <stone>	stone: great discussions - have to be careful as we debate the big topics of verifiable claims vis-a-vis community group and data model spec charted by W3C

[Tue 11:27:38] <les>	Richard: felt that new people added great value. appreciated the overlap with the IIW gang
[Tue 11:28:43] <les>	Matt: echo richard's statements. lot of work to do where the boundaries are
[Tue 11:29:22] <les>	Matt: challanging to stay focused on the two domains. First is data model/syntax, second is business rules layered on top of that.
[Tue 11:29:28] <Drummond>	I have to drop off the call now, but I agree that the in-person meeting was highly productive and informative (especially for the new folks)

[Tue 11:34:34] <Ryladog>	+1
[Tue 11:35:00] <les>	Archer: I have a question for the group. If you have an implemenation and someone comes up with a new point that changes the spec are you willing to change your implementation to match with the new updates?

[Tue 11:36:12] <les>	Manu: I can only speak for Digital Bazaar's implementation of Verifiable Claims. I know Accreditrust also has one, he'll have to speak for Accreditrust. you have to be careful about how you ask that question, there are many people here that have implemented open badges and are integrating them into Verifaible Claims. So, those people will have to speak up as well. For those that have implemented, please speak up now.
[Tue 11:36:12] <les>	Richard: We're in the OpenBadge implementation space, the reason we haven't done more is because it doesn't meet our needs for Verifiable Claims, we've implemented, but are anticipating changes and we, ETS, are willing and needing to implement changes in the spec.
[Tue 11:36:14] <CarlaCasilli>	The open badges spec is shifting hands to IMS Global 1/1/2017, so that question is a larger question than it was in the past.

[Tue 11:38:05] <e_korb_rm>	Q+
[Tue 11:38:15] <les>	Stone: Hi, Matt Stone from Pearson. We have a product called Acclaim that is an implementation of Open Badges, driving needs that we're talking about in Verifiable Claims. Our challenge is to bring these things together so they're less discretely different.
[Tue 11:38:15] <les>	Manu: So Phil, I hope that answers your question, we have organizations that have implemented and they're willing to update their implementations based on potential Verifiable Claims WG output.
[Tue 11:40:26] <les>	Eric: Eric Korb from Accreditrust, we have implementatoins of Verifiable Claims data format, also integrated Open Badges, we can support both formats. We believe Verifiable Claims format is the best one. We are very open to adopting what happens with the spec, we have seen the "proof in the pudding". We are also very involved in Open Badges and IMS Global, so we're happy to join forces and bring these groups together in a common standard.

[Tue 11:38:51] <les>	Archer: I imagine that there will be some changes but they should be a small delta. This has happened for PoE and ODRL. No one wants to rewrite everything, some delta may come up, some willingness to change is good.

[Tue 11:44:26] <les>	Manu: Input is mostly from Tantek from Mozilla, Microsoft, Google, and Akamai
[Tue 11:44:47] <gkellogg>	Tantekâ€™s sig indicates heâ€™s Web Standards Lead at Mozilla, so this would seem to be an official response to me.
[Tue 11:44:49] <les>	Manu: Tantek is asking if this is all just cheerleeding or is it real - are there implementations
[Tue 11:45:02] <les>	Manu: yes it is real ... our discussions above are proof of implementations
[Tue 11:45:23] *	dlongley Blockstream also implementing, not present on call today.
[Tue 11:45:35] <les>	Manu: we have lots of real participants who are comitted to the effort and interoperability and implementations

[Tue 11:46:00] <les>	Manu: are there people implementing
[Tue 11:46:07] <les>	Manu: do we need a working group
[Tue 11:46:26] <les>	Manu: consensus at the f2f. yes there are people implementing
[Tue 11:46:52] <les>	Manu: we need a working group due to the number of companies that want to come together to interopeable implementations

[Tue 11:49:11] *	ShaneM dlongley ++
[Tue 11:49:14] <les>	Manu: can send an email back refering to minutes and the audio and CC those that spoke up as a response. This can start a dialog with those that have expressed its importance

[Tue 11:53:17] <les>	Archer: expects this to go through and there to be a working group starting in Jan
[Tue 11:54:04] <les>	Manu: we will put that response together
[Tue 11:54:19] <les>	Manu: calls should shift to technical issues
[Tue 11:54:29] <Ryladog>	There is frustration, and hopefully we can get to the work
[Tue 11:54:36] <les>	Manu: will continue to be responsive to questions but we should be getting more technical
