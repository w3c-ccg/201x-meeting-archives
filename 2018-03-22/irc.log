[09:13] <Kerri_lemoie> Kimhd: Giving a presentation of what we've done so far. This is our first kick-off meeting. What we've done so far is technical. Seeking use cases from the larger group .Informal group focused on use cases and prototypes. CCG and spinoffs motivated by educational scenarios but examples so far are drivers licenses, etc....While Verifiable claims uses cases are broad, it's important we understand the lifecycle and various use cases.

[09:24] <Kerri_lemoie> agropper: new to open badges. Can someone explain the business issue of open badges and what caused the open badges, biz problem being solved, etc..?
[09:24] <Kerri_lemoie> kimhd: great question - can someone in the group answer?
[09:25] <Kerri_lemoie> ottonomy: open badge is a visual token of a defined achievement with an image component and meta data about the achievement.
[09:26] <Kerri_lemoie> ...An issuer makes a claim that a recipient of a badge made this achievement and the issuer confirms this claim.
[09:26] <Kerri_lemoie> ...Been around since 2011. Originally created by Mozilla with support by MacArthur and now supported by IMS.
[09:27] <Kerri_lemoie> Kimhd: One of the things learning machine became interested in given that open badges exist, it would be compelling for recipients to be able to re-use the envelope.
[09:28] <Kerri_lemoie> agropper: curious about the business side - reputation management or like the national student clearinghouse. What is the business interest that drives Open Badges?
[09:29] <Kerri_lemoie> Serge: It's a question of use cases. Give people the power to recognize other people besides institutions.
[09:30] <Kerri_lemoie> ...Interested in how verifiable claims can support-how to claim a badge without an issuer platform?
[09:30] <Kerri_lemoie> ...What if there is one issuer and multiple recipients. So many use cases that aren't possible yet with open badges yet.
[09:31] <Kerri_lemoie> kimhd: Learning Machine is in the space with educational providers supporting Serge's point. For instance, how to maintain and verify records? Institutions don't necessarily want to be the ones verifying records.
[09:32] <Kerri_lemoie> Kimhd: If education institutions go out of business, how do you prove achievements?
[09:32] <Kerri_lemoie> q+
[09:34] <Kerri_lemoie> Stuart: CER - develop a rich descriptive language for credentials.
[09:34] <Kerri_lemoie>
[09:35] <Kerri_lemoie> ...Explore the CTDL in the context of open badges. The CDTL can be compared to a badge class in Open Badges.
[09:35] <Kerri_lemoie> ...the Credential Engine Registry is where credentials can be stored and found.
[09:36] <Kerri_lemoie> ...Same ecosystem. Be good players and support where CER can provide richer descriptions.
[09:36] <ottonomy> (For openbadges-uninitiated, ob:BadgeClass and ceterms:Credential are in parallel, as a defined credential that might be awarded to many recipients. ob:Assertion -- the award to an individual that is parallel to the vc:Credential is not modeled in the Credential Engine Registry)
[09:36] <kimhd> Kerri_lemoie: back to business models
[09:37] <kimhd> ...other business use cases are professional development -- teachers, nurses, ... using OB as representations
[09:37] <ottonomy> Right, @Kerri_lemoie continuing education requirements often use Open Badges as verifiable representations of professional development. Good one.
[09:37] <kimhd>  Kerri_lemoie: we've seen OB use in after school programs, informal settings. Latter is powerful because it challenges use cases
[09:37] <kimhd> ...e.g. recognition in open source communities
[09:38] <RandyIA> yes +1 for open badges afterschool and other informal learning sessions.
[09:38] <kimhd> Kerri_lemoie: can be a digital cred to recognize something that's formal and informal
[09:38] <ottonomy> Very valuable to preserve both the informal and formal use cases for defined achievements
[09:40] <jeborsel> q+
[09:40] <kimhd> q?
[09:40] <Serge> Open badges were designed to make informal learning visible, but there greatest potential is in making informal recognition visible. And verifiable claims are a good match for that
[09:40] <kimhd> ack jeborsel
[09:40] <Kerri_lemoie> jeborsel: use case -- flexibility of the badge class - can be issued by anyone where the issuer can be a creator too .Is that possible with Verifiable Credentials? Is it possible for anyone to issue a badge if they aren't the creator? (is that right?)
[09:43] <Kerri_lemoie> ottonomy: one of the things we're working on (prototype) in this group is called peer claims: where a badge class can be issued by other issuers.
[09:44] <Kerri_lemoie> ...Achievement should be recognized as the same thing no matter who issues it.
[09:44] <ottonomy> https://bit.ly/peerclaims-rwot6
[09:44] <Kerri_lemoie> jeborsel: is it related to formal or informal?
[09:44] <Kerri_lemoie> ottonomy: both
[09:44] <Kerri_lemoie> ...Use cases for both
[09:44] <kimhd> ack agropper
[09:45] <Kerri_lemoie> agropper: our use case, the issuer of a credential can be a physician: in order to prescribe a controlled substance is if another physician is involved and vouches.
[09:45] <ottonomy> Serge has long suggested use cases requiring that the issuer of an Assertion themselves only needs to hold a particular badge.
[09:46] <Kerri_lemoie> agropper: a need for individuals, not just institutions to be able to issue credentials
[09:47] <Kerri_lemoie> Kimhd: Next steps: send around a poll about what problems we should solve
[09:48] <Kerri_lemoie> ...There is a paper written about alignment of verifiable credentials and open badges - interested in feedback.
[09:48] <Kerri_lemoie> ...Group up by interests
[09:48] <Kerri_lemoie> ...Meetings will be topic based.

[09:50] * kimhd sorry Nate still need to make the updates I promised. Doing it today! And I'll update RWOT github too
[09:50] <Kerri_lemoie> ...Prototype for how to develop an open badge assertion as a verifiable credential using linked data signatures using dids as recipient or issuer dientifiers ending with use cases.
[09:50] <Kerri_lemoie> ...Will be published this spring but ready for commentary
[09:50] <Kerri_lemoie> ...Two options to consider
[09:51] <Kerri_lemoie> ...(for prototype)
[09:52] <Kerri_lemoie> Action item: review and add your comments
[09:52] <Kerri_lemoie> Kimhd: can use the ccg mailing list
[09:52] <Kerri_lemoie> ...public-credentials@w3.org
[09:52] <ottonomy> ottonomy: Sign up for the CCG here: https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/

[09:53] <Kerri_lemoie> Communities FAQ: https://www.w3.org/community/about/faq/
[09:54] <ottonomy> There is a very strong place for self-asserted claims in the future of Open Badges.
[09:55] <agropper> q+
[09:55] <Kerri_lemoie> Cherie: Dominode interested in self-asserted use case, Many types of achievements not recognized yet and we need to provide the on-ramp to use these standards for them.
[09:56] <Serge> An interesting document to justify the need for more open recognition: https://digimusingsblog.wordpress.com/2018/03/15/incomplete-recognition-of-peoples-talents/
[09:56] <kimhd> ack agropper
[09:56] <Kerri_lemoie> ottonomy: Badgr pathways for example about tracking badges but also about employers posting positions and applicants being able to post self asserted applications.
[09:57] * kimhd yes, yes and more yes
[09:57] <Kerri_lemoie> agropper: revocation needs to be considered
[09:57] <ottonomy> @agropper revocation has always been part of the Open Badges use cases and protocols. Not that we have specifically better technology for it than VCs have so far. HTTP statuses and lists of revoked ids so far...
[09:58] <Kerri_lemoie> kimhd: yes to revocation
[09:59] <Kerri_lemoie> ...need to consider privacy and other aspects to consider with revocation so its a helpful topic
[09:59] <Kerri_lemoie> ...Would be good to have more eyes on revocation
[10:00] <Kerri_lemoie> kimhd: will reach out with the poll. Next meeting will be about poll results.
