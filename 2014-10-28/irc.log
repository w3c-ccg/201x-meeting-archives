[Tue 14:25:10] <m4nu>	audio: none
[Tue 14:25:10] <m4nu>	Present: Manu Sporny, JÃ¶rg Heuer, Glen Wiley, Patrick Adler, Karen O'Donoghue, Mountie Lee, Pindar Wong, Evert Fekkes, Eric Korb, Bill Gebert, Brian Sletten, Mary Bold, Daniel Buchner, Shane McCarron, Josh Soref
[Tue 14:25:24] <m4nu>	Topic: Introduction
[Tue 14:25:24] <m4nu>	Here's the presentation deck for the intro: http://opencreds.org/presentations/2014/tpac-credentials/
[Tue 14:28:43] <bsletten>	Manu: This is an attempt to do serious things on the Web by being able to make strong claims about what we are entitled to in a safe and secure way.
[Tue 14:28:43] *	joe_h has quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[Tue 14:29:12] <bsletten>	Manu: This is not an official W3C group, it's a community group. Provides input and experiments to feed into the IG work.
[Tue 14:30:46] <bsletten>	Gebert: ETS needs to provide credentialing for professional development and education, but there are serious national security concerns about foreign nationals being validated for entrance into the U.S. by way of higher educational acceptance.
[Tue 14:32:08] <bsletten>	Joerg: Please add an 's' to Deutche Telekom on the slide. :)
[Tue 14:33:55] <bsletten>	Manu: Badge Alliance and Open Payments Foundation bridge the boundaries between technology collaborators (Web Payments CG, Credentials CG, Web Payments IG, IETF) and policy/regulator collaborators (US Dept of ???, educational institutions, Internet Governance Forum, US Fed)
[Tue 14:35:36] <bsletten>	Adler: The Fed is interested in the soundness of the economy and consumer-facing requirements, opportunities for value exchange, the processing, etc.
[Tue 14:37:21] <bsletten>	Manu: The Master Plan is to convince the W3C and WP IG that Credentials are important enough to become their own group with applicability across multiple communities. Wants to talk advantage of the WP IG to short-track the spin out of groups to focus on a narrow set of Identity as a Credentials Group.
[Tue 14:37:56] <bsletten>	Manu: Credentials are important for anti money laundering, Know Your Customer, etc.
[Tue 14:38:39] <bsletten>	Manu: There is a lot of overlap between the financial services and credential management.
[Tue 14:39:13] <bsletten>	Manu: This is a very narrowly-focused approach avoiding the "solving the Identity on the Web" problem.
[Tue 14:39:28] <bsletten>	Topic: Identity Proofing
[Tue 14:39:28] <bsletten>	Joerg: Will we succeed until we solve this Identity on the Web problem?
[Tue 14:39:43] <bsletten>	Manu: We need to have an Identifier. Identity means different things to different people.
[Tue 14:40:14] <bsletten>	Joerg: When you want to prove that I am German, you need to know who *I* is.
[Tue 14:40:48] <bsletten>	Joerg: Credentials seem very much tied to the person. So Identity needs to be solved, no?
[Tue 14:41:32] <bsletten>	Buchner: Credentials are more of a specification to represent various identities (government, education, etc.).
[Tue 14:41:49] <bsletten>	Manu: We don't have a clear definition of Identity.
[Tue 14:42:55] <bsletten>	Eric: We have to find point of contacts to establish identity. We need Experian and companies like that to help establish the Identity.
[Tue 14:43:03] <bsletten>	Buchner: They provide the Last Mile of Identity.
[Tue 14:43:22] *	halindrome has quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[Tue 14:44:08] <bsletten>	Buchner: There is a Many-to-One Relationship to Identity.
[Tue 14:44:54] <bsletten>	Gebert: There are various levels of Identity. Bronze level, Silver level, Gold level based on the background or strength of the individual identities.
[Tue 14:45:19] <bsletten>	Adler: The Credentials themselves are just a collection of attributes from a particular entity.
[Tue 14:46:26] <bsletten>	Evert: The trust level is established as part of the enrollment process.
[Tue 14:47:11] *	halindrome (~halindrom@12.199.206.2) has joined #credentials
[Tue 14:47:13] <bsletten>	Buchner: It's easier to get buy in by having a mechanism for expressing these credentials and then saying, "Hey, Government, we have a way of expressing this..."
[Tue 14:47:40] <bsletten>	Adler: Accumulation of identity across a variety of sources.
[Tue 14:48:06] <bsletten>	Glen: Sounds like we are talking about authorization, not just Identity.
[Tue 14:48:56] <bsletten>	Buchner: This credential can evolve over time and accumulate more attributes over time.
[Tue 14:50:09] <bsletten>	Manu: I think we are in violent agreement about what a credential is and how we establish trust in existing identities.
[Tue 14:51:26] <bsletten>	Joerg: In Germany we have a National ID by which we can now interact with the Web and it has the ability express a strong level of confidence of identity.
[Tue 14:52:17] <bsletten>	Adler: We talk a lot of about binding the identity to the user. There is also the idea of attaching context to the binding. Time of day, duration, in particular contexts.
[Tue 14:52:30] <bsletten>	Buchner: We need enough inputs on the credential to express these context.
[Tue 14:53:00] <bsletten>	Eric: My wife needs four credentials just to come to work as nurse practitioner in NJ.
[Tue 14:53:35] <bsletten>	Eric: If her malpractice insurance expired, she can't get into the pharmacy to get medications.
[Tue 14:54:26] <bsletten>	Joerg: Combinations of different credentials make a lot of sense to establish the context.
[Tue 14:55:35] <bsletten>	Topic: Scope of CG Work
[Tue 14:55:35] <bsletten>	Manu: The clear sign that this initiative will fail is if the Use Cases keep growing. If it looks like we are heading down to a very complex endeavor, that's a sign that we are solving the wrong problem.
[Tue 14:56:01] <bsletten>	Manu: We can't prescribe how you get a Level 3 National Identity card.
[Tue 14:56:19] <bsletten>	Manu: Education has a different set of requirements than healthcare. That's not the problem we want to solve.
[Tue 14:56:42] <bsletten>	Buchner: There are different ways to take a fingerprint (ink vs camera). I don't want to specify what it means to express a fingerprint.
[Tue 14:56:44] *	pindarhk (77ecf0d0@gateway/web/freenode/ip.119.236.240.208) has joined #credentials
[Tue 14:57:40] <bsletten>	Gebert: Who determines what is High Stakes. It's the consumer who decides. The level of sophistication and compliance is the consumer itself, not the binding.
[Tue 14:58:50] <bsletten>	Gebert: We collect retina scan, fingerprints, etc. to deal with fraud. That might be Gold Standard identity to some people, but not others.
[Tue 14:59:36] <bsletten>	Buchner: These things he's talking about didn't exist twenty years ago. Our definition of the standards or faith in them change over time.
[Tue 15:00:22] <bsletten>	Adler: The bindings can change in time during expiration of credentials and re-upping the identity. You get a new token or a new card.
[Tue 15:00:53] <bsletten>	Glen: It seems we need to talk more than just about transmission of credentials.
[Tue 15:03:14] <bsletten>	Brian: The use of JSON-LD will allow us to model different kinds of credentials (Fingerprint vs InkFingerprint).
[Tue 15:03:47] <bsletten>	Joerg: We should think about both sides of this: Who is guaranteeing the credentials and the consumer who is establishing a level of trust.
[Tue 15:04:56] <bsletten>	Manu: Fantastic discussion, I am hearing a lot of agreement and it seems aligned with the definition of CG.
[Tue 15:07:08] <karen_od>	Here is a link to the IETF mailing list that is starting a discussion around vectors of trust or levels of assurance.
[Tue 15:07:09] <karen_od>	https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/vot
[Tue 15:08:43] <karen_od>	There is no chartered work at this point, but this is a preliminary mailing list to discuss possible directions that this might go, and one of the possible directions might be contributing to an update of NIST SP 800-63
[Tue 15:10:37] <bsletten>	Joerg: I don't think Payment requires Identity. You need sufficient funds. Cash is useful for anonymous interactions we should protect it.
[Tue 15:11:52] <bsletten>	Adler: What does this mean at the Protocol Level? What are the core components of the transaction? Identity is part of some transactions, but not other.
[Tue 15:15:15] <bsletten>	Joerg: Even if we don't establish the identity of the consumer for the payment, we are still dealing with pseudonyms and technical identifiers like email accounts ("Mickey Mouse identity") and that may still be important to keep track of.
[Tue 15:15:35] <bsletten>	Evert: Each Identity maps to a certain context.
[Tue 15:16:17] <bsletten>	Adler: Entitlement can apply to groups. Buying as a member of group (digital media, Kickstarter, etc.)
[Tue 15:16:43] <bsletten>	Adler: There can be multiple identities associated with a payment.

[Tue 15:24:15] *	timeless (sid4015@firefox/developer/timeless) has joined #credentials
[Tue 15:26:55] <bsletten>	Brian: Access control specification sounds like a different approach than not prescribing the credentials. In order for me to express a restricted use of credentials, we need to agree on what that means.
[Tue 15:28:26] <bsletten>	Adler: We need to protect the transmission of the credentials via extensible authorization and authentication mechanisms as well.
[Tue 15:28:26] <bsletten>	Manu: Ok, let's break for lunch and meet back here in an hour to dive into the use cases, specs, or demos.
[Tue 15:28:26] <bsletten>	Group breaks for lunch.

[Tue 16:36:06] <karen_od>	Topic: Use Cases / Future Work
[Tue 16:36:06] <karen_od>	scribe: karen_od
[Tue 16:36:06] <karen_od>	Manu: options for what we could do this afternoon (use cases, draft specs, demos, etc...)
[Tue 16:38:31] <karen_od>	Joerg: we could try to distill the earlier conversation
[Tue 16:38:54] <karen_od>	Buchner: would use cases accomplish this?
[Tue 16:39:48] <karen_od>	Manu: since this is a CG we can recharter at any point based on a vote of the group itself
[Tue 16:40:37] <karen_od>	Manu: before we start adding use cases, we should look at the ones we already have
[Tue 16:41:34] <karen_od>	Adler: we could analyze the use cases for domain factors and look for commonality
[Tue 16:42:27] <karen_od>	Adler: need to visualize the relationships, one to one, one to many, many to one, etc
[Tue 16:43:04] <karen_od>	Manu: we should probably develop something like that
[Tue 16:43:29] <karen_od>	Adler: I will make a first attempt at this graphic
[Tue 16:45:26] <karen_od>	Manu: these use cases were taken out of the Web Payments workshop
[Tue 16:45:47] *	m4nu (0cc7ce02@gateway/web/freenode/ip.12.199.206.2) has joined #credentials
[Tue 16:45:47] <karen_od>	Buchner: What vantage point were these use cases taken from
[Tue 16:45:57] <m4nu>	http://opencreds.org/specs/source/use-cases/
[Tue 16:46:50] <karen_od>	Manu: this document is nowhere near done
[Tue 16:46:56] *	tanvi (0cc7ce02@gateway/web/freenode/ip.12.199.206.2) has joined #credentials
[Tue 16:48:06] <karen_od>	Joerg: Are we expecting credentials to live on forever?
[Tue 16:48:24] <karen_od>	Eric: They have a expiration date
[Tue 16:49:00] <karen_od>	Topic: Identifier Portability
[Tue 16:49:00] <karen_od>	Manu: The key that we have found, when we are creating the credential we need to ensure that we don't tie it to something that can't be moved. It's strange, but URLs are great at achieving vendor lock-in.
[Tue 16:50:23] <karen_od>	Manu: there will have to be revocation lists
[Tue 16:51:13] <karen_od>	... two sides of a credential, customer and user,
[Tue 16:51:36] <karen_od>	Joerg: would this be optional because there may be privacy problems here
[Tue 16:54:18] *	bsletten (0cc7ce02@gateway/web/freenode/ip.12.199.206.2) has joined #credentials
[Tue 16:54:29] <karen_od>	... further discussion on how revocation might work and decisions involved
[Tue 16:55:47] <karen_od>	Buchner: are there any steps involved when reissuing or moving credentials?
[Tue 16:57:26] <karen_od>	Eric: Open badges today uses Persona, email address is embedded,
[Tue 16:58:00] <karen_od>	Eric: every time it is moved it goes through a validation process, the question is whether it should also go through a verification process
[Tue 16:58:49] <karen_od>	Eric: how do you move them, what happens when you move one from the university.
[Tue 17:00:13] <karen_od>	Adler: is an identity provider the same as a credential provider, they are different things?
[Tue 17:00:23] <karen_od>	... can they play both roles?
[Tue 17:00:56] <karen_od>	Manu: two sets of terminology currently in use (Badge Alliance and Credentials CG)
[Tue 17:01:57] <karen_od>	... credential servers store credentials issued by issuers
[Tue 17:02:42] <karen_od>	Eric: credential curator (backpack, key chain)
[Tue 17:03:16] <karen_od>	...long term issuer independent storage
[Tue 17:05:46] <karen_od>	glen: difference between registrar and registry
[Tue 17:08:07] <karen_od>	Glen: there are example of this type of critical service in internet infrastructure
[Tue 17:09:07] <karen_od>	Manu: there are examples of decentralized service but they don't exist in a web context
[Tue 17:10:18] <karen_od>	Glen: there are very few things that the government can't shut down, (stipulating that it has to be safe from government intervention)
[Tue 17:11:36] <karen_od>	Manu: telehash is an interesting example of a technology that might address some of this
[Tue 17:12:04] <karen_od>	Manu: it is a decentralized hash on that
[Tue 17:12:44] <karen_od>	Manu: objective is to have at least one technology solution that will solve the problem
[Tue 17:15:10] <karen_od>	Manu: we can solve the problem without providing this decentralized solution by tying the credential to the provider
[Tue 17:16:26] <karen_od>	Glen: you could get credentials from different organizations based on your level of faith in their longevity
[Tue 17:16:59] <karen_od>	Brian: you get the credentials from the organization that you have the most trust in
[Tue 17:17:21] <karen_od>	Topic: Data Rights, Legacy Support
[Tue 17:17:21] <karen_od>	Manu: Data rights ... almost like a reverse terms of service
[Tue 17:18:52] <karen_od>	Buchner: Isn't this another example of an area where
[Tue 17:20:12] <karen_od>	Manu: If they have a text file about you, you can copy
[Tue 17:20:51] <karen_od>	Manu: data rights is a policy representation, not a technical solution
[Tue 17:21:13] <karen_od>	Manu: data rights is a high level design criteria without a technical solution
[Tue 17:22:48] <karen_od>	Manu: Legacy Support: is there a way we can provide both the old way (user name and password) and the new way (credential based) with the new credential
[Tue 17:23:15] <karen_od>	Manu: Last Pass is an example of this
[Tue 17:23:43] <karen_od>	Joerg: are we to replace user name and password with this?
[Tue 17:24:36] <karen_od>	Joerg: sounds like OAUTH to me.
[Tue 17:26:28] <karen_od>	Manu: there are other technologies out there, OAUTH is more about access control
[Tue 17:26:55] <karen_od>	...we could wrap OAUTH credentials in the system.
[Tue 17:27:27] <karen_od>	Manu: what is the best thing for web developers, they don't want to implement OAUTH 2.0
[Tue 17:28:11] <karen_od>	Manu: don't know how all this plays with OpenID Connect or OAUTH
[Tue 17:28:42] <karen_od>	Manu: OAUTH 1.0 and OAUTH 2.0 aren't really competitors to this, OpenID Connect is a more open question
[Tue 17:29:34] <karen_od>	Manu: we have now completely destroyed our agenda, but that's ok because we're having a great discussion. Great to see how aligned most of us are.
[Tue 17:30:25] <karen_od>	Buchner: it is helpful to know there is a decision trusted providers as a/the mechanism
[Tue 17:31:48] <karen_od>	Adler: four key things... (scribe missed the four key things)
[Tue 17:35:20] <karen_od>	Manu: we have to have a way to have verifiable claims
[Tue 17:37:22] *	tanvi has quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[Tue 17:38:20] <karen_od>	Eric: we see three kinds of transactions 1) establish identities; 2) make offers; 3) verify information
[Tue 17:40:01] <karen_od>	Eric: TrueCred Api slide
[Tue 17:41:50] <karen_od>	Manu: Flexible access control is about the user not being present to perform a credential exchange. For example, you authorizing emergency workers to access your credential in the event of an emergency.
[Tue 17:43:09] <karen_od>	Manu: We want to support two types of signatures - original credential plus endorsement (a set of signatures)
[Tue 17:44:38] <karen_od>	Manu: chained credentials (an array of dependent signatures, each one dependent on the previous one)
[Tue 17:45:25] *	mountie has quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[Tue 17:45:34] <karen_od>	Manu: Wrapup - we didn't cover much of our agenda, but did a good bit of ground work. This is a community group open to anyone, great to see so much interest in it. We meet Tuesdays at 11am ET. Learn more here: http://opencreds.org/minutes/
