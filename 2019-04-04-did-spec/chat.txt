22:08:15	 From Drummond Reed : Meeting Page: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qYBaXQMUoB86Alquu7WBtWOxsS8SMhp1fioYKEGCabE/edit#
22:14:31	 From Chrisb : if you add chris@lifeid.io as an editor I will help edit
22:17:14	 From Drummond Reed : Will do that now Chris
22:18:10	 From Drummond Reed : Done - you are now an editor
22:18:24	 From Drummond Reed : Anyone else who wants to be an editor, let me know
22:22:34	 From Digital Bazaar : Anyone have the link to the slide deck we're looking at?
22:22:53	 From Drummond Reed : Markus is displaying it; I don’t know if he’s shared it yet
22:23:04	 From Digital Bazaar : k thx, sorry I'm late -- had a meeting go over.
22:23:18	 From Drummond Reed : Is that Dimtri?
22:23:30	 From Digital Bazaar : Manu :)
22:23:47	 From Drummond Reed : Ah, okay (just says “Digital Bazaar”
22:24:08	 From Drummond Reed : Note that we haven’t been using IRC because no one on the call so far knew how to start it
22:24:16	 From Drummond Reed : we could switch to using it if you want
22:24:30	 From Drummond Reed : otherwise we’re just taking notes in the meeting page and then emailing that to the list
22:24:42	 From Digital Bazaar : you just dial in and it starts automatically...
22:24:53	 From Digital Bazaar : notes and emailing to list are probably fine... just need to be careful of IPR concerns.
22:25:02	 From Drummond Reed : Oh, okay, that’s it? You just call the number and enter the code?
22:25:05	 From Drummond Reed : Cool
22:25:07	 From Digital Bazaar : but I see things are being recorded, so that's good.
22:25:17	 From Digital Bazaar : yes, just call the number, do the code... all of it fires up
22:25:24	 From Digital Bazaar : and publishes minutes after the last person leaves.
22:25:38	 From Drummond Reed : Man, just like an agent should! ;-)
22:25:44	 From Digital Bazaar : :P
22:26:04	 From Drummond Reed : So what do you suggest we do - fire it up now, or just continue this meeting with meeting page notes?
22:27:25	 From Digital Bazaar : let's just keep going
22:27:35	 From Digital Bazaar : no need to fire it up now because it'll only have half of the minutes.
22:27:46	 From Digital Bazaar : Markus has been publishing stuff appropriately, IIRC.
22:27:57	 From Drummond Reed : Got it. We’ll fire it up for second call.
22:28:53	 From Digital Bazaar : +1, diagram is great
